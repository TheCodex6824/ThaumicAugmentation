tc.research_category.THAUMIC_AUGMENTATION=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.title=Thaumic Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.0=I'll dedicate this section of the Thaumonomicon to any miscellaneous discoveries I make. Who knows what I may come up with?

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.title=Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=As I noted before, iron is a very poor vis conductor. It gets the job done, but now that I have discovered thaumium, it should be a simple task to upgrade my old caster's gauntlet prototype to be much more effective than before.<BR>While I am making modifications, I might as well investigate enchanted fabric's usefulness as a replacement for leather.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=I have successfully created the new casting gauntlet, which I am (uncreatively) calling the Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet. The introduction of Thaumium allows the caster to be more about 10% more efficient with the usage of Vis, in addition to slightly reducing the cooldown between casts.<BR>It seems that the enchanted fabric takes very well to dyes - I only need to combine the gauntlet with one or more dyes on a mundane crafting table to get a new colour. To remove the dye, I need to use the gauntlet on a filled, mundane cauldron.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=Voidseer Caster's Gauntlet
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=While the thaumium casting gauntlet was certainly a success, I can't help but wonder if void metal is as effective a vis conductor as thaumium is. Even if it isn't, I have trouble believing its morphic properties won't have some benefit. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=My results so far have been surprisingly disappointing. I have seen a small reduction in the vis cost of casting, but not enough to outweigh thaumium's faster recharge abilities.<BR>Perhaps I have been looking at the wrong component to improve...
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=It seems my previous conjecture has proven to be correct. Upon replacing the vis resonator with a voidseer's pearl, the gauntlet felt much more connected to the surrounding aura. So connected, in fact, that not only have I measured a 30% vis discount over my original prototype, but it also absorbs vis over a much wider area. Hopefully this will mean I can cast with very complex foci without depleting the local aura nearly as quickly as before.<BR>It seems that while the cooldown time of this gauntlet is still better than the original caster, the thaumium gauntlet is still superior in this regard. I will have to decide which trait, vis usage or cooldown time, I find more valuable. Luckily, the ability to dye the gauntlet was retained from its predecessor. The method to apply and remove dye is the same as for the thaumium gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.title=Vis Regenerator
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.0=As I have come to experience, a session of advanced arcane crafting or foci casting can leave the aura completely depleted. I should try to find something that can help regenerate the aura a bit quicker than letting it recover naturally.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=I have drawn up plans for a device I am calling the Vis Regenerator. It consists of a lattice layer, made of silverwood leaves and an essentia filter, with an outer casing that attempts to "recirculate" the aura through the lattice.<BR>An interesting characteristic of this device is that the effectiveness seems to be tied to the total capacity of the local aura. In other words, areas that naturally have a low amount of vis will experience a higher rate of regeneration.<BR>If I need to disable the Vis Regenerator for any reason, applying a redstone signal should do the job.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.2=Because of the Vis Regenerator's delicate relationship with the local aura, I should avoid using it in areas with a lot of flux. I have a feeling it would the make aura pollution much worse...

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.title=Seal Copier
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=Configuring golem seals by hand is fine for small projects, but when stacks of seals get involved it becomes tedious and error-prone. I should research a way to quickly configure large amounts of seals.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=I have created plans for a basic seal copying device. I just need to configure one seal with the settings I need, then right click it with the copier. I then only need to right click every other seal I want to apply the settings to. If I want to clear the memory of the copier, I need to right click while sneaking. I can then copy new settings and continue.<BR>It seems that the seal copier is unable to interact with seals that were not placed by the owner. I should keep this in mind if I am working with other Thaumaturges.

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.title=Control Seal: Secure
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.0=Though I have already created a seal that will make golems protect a specific area, I feel this does not cover the entirety of what may be possible with combat golems. In fact, it should be trivial to apply the principle that the guard seal uses for small areas, but to instead incite golems to attack any monsters that they can see.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.1=After a very simple modification, the guard seal has become the secure seal. This control seal will incite any appropriate combat capable golems to attack any threat that they can see in their operating range, as opposed to threats in a small area. Unlike most other seals, the secure seal does not have a configurable area - instead, the seal will make nearby golems attack intruding creatures within the fixed (but much larger) range of the seal. However, this means I should take extra care to ensure that golems do not attack anything they're not supposed to, as the outcome of such a mishap would be very disappointing.
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.2=I am now able to create an advanced version of this seal. This advanced version will allow me to have better control of what combat golems with biothaumic minds will attack, and if they should only care about targets that are within their line of sight.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=Further Auromancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=I have already discovered quite a few elemental foci effects, but I feel there is still much more to discover. There are so many aspects of essentia I have not experimented with that I am bound to find something useful.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=Focus Effect: Light
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=While fire does give off light, it can be a bit... destructive. It should be somewhat simple to create an effect completely dedicated to giving off light. To begin, I should examine some light sources I already have access to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=The light pattern does exactly what I was hoping - it creates a bright light source wherever it is used. The light source will even be able to last forever - meaning I can use it for permanent lighting if I wish.<BR>I do wonder what would happen if a living creature was exposed to this pattern's blast of light.

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=Warded Arcana
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=While browsing some of the old manuscripts in the Thaumonomicon, I came across a section that described the applications of warding arcana. Being able to create objects that are protected against everything except its owner sounds like something I should investigate. I should begin my studies by examining the warded device I have already created, the Warded Jar.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=My examination of the Warded Jar provided me with all I need to know - it should be possible to apply protective properties to almost all materials, so long as I apply a special rune to the object first. While I'm excited by the possibilities this can lead to, I think it would be best to start with something simple - like a chest.
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=By taking a mundane chest and applying a warding sigil, I have created a container that is not only almost invoidable to all outside forces, but is also only accessible to me. This means I cannot use neither traditional methods of extracting and inserting items, such as hoppers, nor golems - maybe this is something I can look into in the future.<BR>Should I want to remove the chest, I need to sneak and then use any casting gauntlet on it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=Arcane Door
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=Now that I have mastered the basics of warding objects, I think I can move on to something a bit more advanced. The original manuscripts I read described an indestructible door, which sounds like something worth researching. After all, replacing doors broken down by zombies does get annoying after a while...
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=I have managed to create the warded door described in the manuscript, which I am calling the Arcane Door. Just like the Warded Chest, the doors will only open for their owner, and are extremely difficult to remove by normal means. I have also made three different styles - greatwood, silverwood, and thaumium. They are all functionally the same, but it is nice to have options for decoration purposes.<BR>If I want to remove the door, I need to sneak and then use the bottom half of it with any casting gauntlet.<BR>It seems that these doors are "smart" in the sense that two doors placed next to each other act as double doors and will open and close together. How convenient.<BR>I have also created trapdoor forms of these doors. They work in the same way as the normal doors, just in a smaller profile.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=Access Control
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=Being able to have private objects is nice and all, but sometimes I need to share my belongings with fellow Thaumaturges. I should devise a way to selectively grant access to those I want to permit.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=I have created objects to allow others to access arbitrary warded objects - keys. But these are not any ordinary keys, as they will learn to emulate the person they are bound to. This seems sufficient to bypass the protections of the wards, provided the bound person matches with the object. Each key works slightly differently - I have written instructions for each type of key on the following pages, should I need to reference them.<PAGE>§lIron Key§r<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>These are the simplest of the three types of keys. To bind one to my warded objects, I need to use it on empty space (it does not need to be used on any block). It will then allow anyone possessing the key access. To unbind the key, I should use the key while sneaking.<PAGE>§lBrass Key§r<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>This key functions in a similar way to the iron key - use to bind, sneak while using to unbind. However, the brass key has the ability to copy its binding to an iron key. To do this, one needs to place both the brass key and an unbound iron key in a mundane crafting grid. The brass key will not be consumed by this process. Copying thaumium keys will be described in the following section. <PAGE>§lThaumium Key§r<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>The thaumium key is interesting in that it does not only bind to beings - it also binds to the object and its location. In other words, this key will permit to access to a single warded object at a location. To bind this key, I need to use it on the warded object I want to bind it to. This binding will still be valid even if I remove and replace the object at a location, but only if it still matches the type of object the key was originally bound to. Sneaking while using the key will unbind it, like the others. To copy a Thaumium key, I need to combine it in a mundane crafting grid with an empty Thaumium key and a brass key bound to the same person as the thaumium key.

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=Void Thaumaturge Boots
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=With void metal allowing me to upgrade most of my existing armour to take advantage of its superior capabilities, it only makes sense for me to try to apply this material to the Boots of the Traveller as well.
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=I have succeeded in upgrading the Boots of the Traveller into a superior form I am calling the Void Thaumaturge Boots. These boots have the expected boosts to speed and jump height over the original (at the cost of slightly increased vis consumption), as well as the auto-repair capabilities of all void metal items. Most notably, fall damage is greatly reduced beyond the jump height of these boots - I can practically fall into a ravine and walk away unharmed.<BR>These boots are also now dyeable. I simply need to craft them with the dye(s) I want to colour them, or use them on a filled, mundane cauldron to wash away the dye.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=Rift Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=I think that flux rifts are much more important to my studies than they may seem. When they are created from an excess of flux, they open and connect to the void. I'm sure that they contain the secret to opening rifts into places that are more... hospitable.<BR>However, studying flux rifts currently requires me to saturate the aura with flux. It might be beneficial to contain all the flux I need into a small "seed" that can then be released into the target area, rather than having to resort to more messy alternatives. I should look into ways to compress a large amount of flux into a small space.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=By concentrating a large amount of Vitium essentia into a void seed, the flux created will shortly be absorbed into the aura and almost certainly create a rift. I should be very careful with these flux seeds - "planting" them will instantly release all of its contained flux, consuming the seed.<BR>It seems that limiting the essentia in the seed to strictly Vitium allows more flux to be created per unit of essentia than just dumping it into the aura. If I want to take advantage of this to create larger rifts, I should be able to infuse even more Vitium into the smaller flux seed. However, not only does the instability in the infusion increase with the amount of Vitium added, but I only seem to be able to safely use this process once on any given flux seed.

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.title=Augmentation
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.0=While creating improved casting gauntlets like the Thaumium gauntlet is great and all, at some point I will be unable to come up with designs for new gauntlets. Maybe I should spend some time thinking of ways to improve the designs I already have. This also presents me with an opportunity to come up with a system that is modular enough to not require constantly replacing gauntlets as I make new advancements in my research.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.1=I have come up with some initial plans for a system to make casting foci more effective. The first component required is a sort of "modifier" that creates additional energy for use by the caster. However, I will need some sort of filter to actually make use of this extra energy - which I think I can create in a similar way to foci. Because these are additions to the existing mechanisms of the gauntlet, I believe I will call this new type of device an "augment".<BR>While I want to be able to apply a wide variety of "modifiers" as the providers of energy to these effect crystals, I should start with something simple. The casting gauntlets I have created thus far all use a Vis Resonator to interface with the aura. Perhaps I can create a type of resonator that is specialised towards a specific aspect of essentia, instead of the entire spectrum of them.<BR>This new elemental resonator modifier should allow the gauntlet to more efficiently use a single aspect of essentia, allowing any focus effects with the same aspect to become more effective. Depending on the focusing crystal I decide to use, one of three traits can be affected - focus power, casting speed, or Vis efficiency. However, due to the way it "magnifies" the aspect, this process is only possible for a single aspect per gauntlet. Still, I'm excited to build a modular augment and see just how effective this new augment system I have devised is in practice.<BR>To actually build this augment, I will need to craft an Elemental Modifier (which acts as the modifier) and combine it with any effect crystal in a crafting grid. Sadly, once they are combined, it is not possible to separate them again. While the plans I have drawn up use an Ordo crystal and power effect crystal as an example, I should be able to use any combination of Vis crystal and effect crystal, depending on which Aspect and trait I want to make more powerful.
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.2=Just as I thought, I have been able to create the final resonator without issue. One unforeseen problem I have discovered with casting, however, is that while a single aspect reacts favourably, one or more other aspects will react negatively to the presence of the resonator. Which aspects they are seems to vary for each aspect. I should experiment with aspects I plan on using to ensure that the foci I wish to use aren't negatively affected.<BR>I can place the Elemental Modifier (or any completed augment with it as the modifier) with any vis crystal in a crafting grid to swap out the internal crystal. I will be able to get the old crystal back as well.<BR>As for the augment system itself, I have designed it to be fairly modular. As I have done before, each augment is made up of a modifier (like the Elemental Modifier) and an effect (one of the three focusing crystals: focus power, casting speed, and Vis cost), combined together in a mundane crafting grid. To apply an augment to a device, I only need to place it with the item (primarily my casting gauntlets so far) to augment in any crafting grid. While it looks like these casting gauntlets should be able to support at least 3 augments without issue, combining multiple augments with the same type of modifier (including Elemental Modifiers with different Aspects) does not seem to be possible. If I need to remove an augment for some reason, placing the gauntlet alone in a crafting grid will remove the most recently added augment. It is possible to add and remove augments an unlimited number of times.<BR>Sadly, I have been unable to get the original Caster's Gauntlet to support my augmentation system. The poor materials used in the gauntlet seem to be unable to handle the additional stress added to it by the augments. Oh well, it was just a prototype anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.title=Dimensional Modifiers
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.0=While the Elemental Modifier was able to increase the effectiveness of casting by reacting to the focus' aspect, an internal stimuli, I should be able to make modifiers that react to external stimuli as well. The simplest of these would be the mundane materials that make up the dimensions I can visit. I should study some samples of materials from each of these places to find out if I can use them for this purpose, and find a way to make the augment improve focus casting whilst I am in the dimensions which these materials originate from.
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.1=I have created three different dimensional modifiers, each one reacting positively from being in the Overworld, the Nether, or the End, respectively. The modifier itself works by using a crystalline structure that resonates when it is brought into the dimension it is linked to, with this linking process being achieved by using resources that come from a certain dimension to create the crystal. While all of these dimensional modifiers will give a benefit, it seems like the modifier for the Nether is stronger than the Overworld's modifier, and the End's modifier is stronger than both. I'm not quite sure why this is the case, especially considering how the latter dimensions generally have lower Vis levels than the Overworld, but I may be able to discover this with further research in the future. Something else may very well be at play here.

thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.title=Modifier: Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.0=Now that I have visited the Emptiness, I should be able to create a dimensional modifier that makes focus casting more powerful there, in the same manner as I did for the three comparatively mundane dimensions I have created modifiers for so far.
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.1=With my experience from creating the previous dimensional modifiers, making one for the Emptiness was an easy task. I simply needed to apply the previous principles of dimensional modifier creation, but instead using Emptiness-specific resources for my research and the inevitable augment modifier creation. This modifier also appears to be as powerful as the End's modifier, so that is a pleasant surprise. I do find it an odd coincidence that the most powerful dimensional modifiers are related to dimensions that are more akin to void worlds, with both the End and the Emptiness being mostly barren floating islands in a starry void. In fact, it may not be a coincidence at all. I fear that the eldritch energies in these dimensions (visible in the quantities of Alienis, Vacuos, and Tenebrae in the materials of these worlds) may be having an effect on the aura. I am unsure of the long-term consequences this may have, but it is almost certainly something I will have to monitor in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.title=Modifier: Frenzy
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.0=Most of my efforts in researching and experimenting with augment modifiers have been focused on passive effects. It may be prudent to try to come up with a system to actively increase my casting abilities while I am using it.<BR>Normally, the flow of Vis through the gauntlet must be regulated to a slow rate, or the device will simply not work. If I am using this Vis frequently enough, it should be possible to slowly increase this limit whilst using the gauntlet. The main problem with this is that precisely monitoring such small differences in Vis usage is not the easiest thing to do, especially with the equipment available to me. But what if there was another way to indirectly measure my Vis usage?<BR>I have considered one way to possibly make this work - during my recent studies in Golemancy, I have created the aggression module, which incites golems to attack other creatures. If I can somehow measure a reaction in the module when damaging something through focus casting, I might be able to use it as a signal to speed up the flow of Vis throughout the gauntlet. I should give my theory a try, but I doubt this will work like I am hoping it will.
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.1=Surprisingly, my idea to make the aggression module regulate the flow of Vis was a success. The aggression module, with some minor adjustments, is able to detect damage done to creatures through focus casting, and will output a measurable signal accordingly. The Frenzy module, as I have come to call it, will thus gradually improve the flow of Vis through the gauntlet and its connected focus. To put it simply, if I continue to deal damage to a monster or any other creature within a relatively short time frame, my casting will gradually become more and more powerful. If I holster my caster or don't damage anything for a period of time, the flow of Vis will immediately reset to its natural level.

thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.title=Modifier: Experience
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.0=While I had made use of the knowledge buried inside experience orbs in devices such as the Headband of Curiosity, I feel I may be able to make use of the knowledge contained within these orbs to better focus the magical energies involved in spell casting. Knowledge is inherently related to Auromancy, as a wiser Thaumaturge is better able to manipulate the Aura, since they have a better understanding of its flow and of the ways to manipulate it to their advantage. Through application of experience levels I may yet find another means of improving my spell casting abilities.
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.1=Knowledge of the Aura gained through research naturally improves one's ability to use it. So it is only logical that experience of the aura indirectly gained through simply living one's life, whether from ordinary activities or more esoteric ones, can also enhance one's Auromancy abilities. In this case, I have managed to create an augment modifier that improves the flow of Vis based on how many experience levels I have gained. I should be able to see a benefit even with low amounts of experience, albeit a small one. It will take me quite a lot of experience to fully utilise this modifier's capabilities - I do suppose that wisdom does not lend itself easily to the inexperienced.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.title=Void Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.0=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This dark-coloured stone can be found in most locales around dimensional fractures. It easily binds to other pieces of itself, meaning it is able to be put back together after being broken. It is also noticeably softer than normal stone.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.1=Tainted Void Stone Soil<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_soil_taint_side_0.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This layer of taint appears on the surface of tainted areas in the Emptiness. Although it still sticks together relatively easily, it seems to be infused with some kind of ancient biological material - similar to the tainted things I have encountered before. Unlike "normal" tainted blocks, it is very stable and will not spread or decay over time.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.2=Tainted Void Stone<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_taint.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>This variant of Void Stone is found in the tainted lands of the Emptiness. Just like its soil counterpart, it will not decay or spread to nearby materials.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.title=Manufacturing Eldritch Stone
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.0=One thing I haven't managed to confirm yet was the mention of a special type of stone in the Crimson Rites - one that was extremely durable and had magical properties that resemble those of Arcane Stone. Although it is lacking in details on its creation, it does mention combining a purple stone with eldritch energy. This purple stone sounds eerily similar to the Void Stone I recently discovered - I need to investigate this for myself.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.1=For better or for worse, the Crimson Cult was right once again. I was able to transform a small piece of Void Stone into the stone described, which I will call Eldritch Stone. Just as the Rites described, this stone is able to withstand almost any explosion, and takes longer than usual to remove with pickaxes and other tools.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.title=Rift Power
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.0=Drawing power from rifts to make void seeds is useful in itself, but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the potential of rift energy. However, before I can find uses for this energy, I need to find a way to extract it into a usable form. 
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.1=Thanks to some research, I have determined that it should be possible to hold energy from rifts in a custom storage cell. This cell will need to have a heavily modified void seed core, which acts as the receptor for the energy.<BR>I suppose I should give this energy a name. Because rift energy seems to be much more volatile than the Vis I've worked with before, I think a suitable name would be "Impetus" - force.<BR>Now all I need is a tool to extract the energy with. Instead of making a dedicated tool for this purpose, I'm confident that I can use my augment system to attach some sort of energy extractor to a casting gauntlet.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.2=I have finally finished creating all I need to begin delving into the uses of Impetus. Not only can the device I created extract power from a rift, it is also capable of releasing it somewhat rapidly. To get started, I should attach the Impetus Conductor to a gauntlet. Then, I only need to stand close to a flux rift and it will slowly drain energy from the rift into the augment.<BR>As with the Void Siphon, drawing energy from the rift will cause it become more unstable, in addition to rapidly shrinking - eventually into nothing. If I don't want to constantly make new flux rifts, I should ensure the rift stays stable and has a healthy size.<BR>While I don't have any other devices that make use of Impetus at the moment, I have noticed a peculiar effect on the casting gauntlet itself. The presence of Impetus seems to slightly increase the power of any focus, without consuming any Impetus to do so. This seems to continue for as long as the attached Impetus Conductor contains at least some energy - the amount does not seem to matter.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.title=Focus Effect: Ward
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.0=Now that I have successfully warded individual objects, I think I should look into applying warding Thaumaturgy to arbitrary materials in the world. While I doubt that any given material will be able to match the strength of dedicated warded blocks, any extra protection is worth investigating. I should experiment with some common means of destruction to get an idea of how far I can go with this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.1=Surprisingly, my experiments went better than I expected - I have created a focus effect capable of warding any simple material placed in the world. "Simple materials" includes objects like stone and dirt that are inert and exhibit no special properties. Sadly, machines are rendered frozen in time by the ward focus, meaning that objects like redstone mechanisms will not work properly while warded. More complex machines will fail to be warded at all.<BR>While I have done my best to protect against as many different methods of destruction as I could, I know I cannot protect against them all. Despite this, I am certain that warded blocks should be immune to manual breaking, normal explosions, fire damage, piston movement and even the effect of gravity on blocks such as gravel or sand.<BR>There are multiple ways to tell if something is warded using this focus effect - the easiest is to punch it. If energy seems to ripple from the impact, then it is surely warded. Holding any casting gauntlet with a warding focus equipped will allow me to directly observe the warding energies around blocks, giving them a shimmering effect in a small area around where I am looking. The colour of this shimmering effect seems to be related to the caster - the particles will be green if I was the caster, but red if it was not me.<BR>To remove the ward on a block, I just need to recast the ward focus on it. In the event that a block is somehow destroyed even while warded, the protection of the ward will fade from that location.<BR>Lastly, I should be careful with what I choose to ward. While experimenting with different objects can be fun, I'm still dealing with an uncharted area of Thaumaturgy. I can't be sure that every block will still work perfectly.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.2=§lGolems§r<DIV>Golems seem to ignore the presence of warded objects when going about their business. If I find that my golems are wandering aimlessly instead of doing their tasks, I should ensure that the blocks they are supposed to interact with are not warded.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.3=§lArcane Bore§r<DIV>The Arcane Bore seems to be intelligent enough to ignore warded blocks and instead mine whatever it can. However, warded blocks will prevent it from mining any blocks behind them. I should ensure the mining area is clear of warded blocks if I wish to use the Arcane Bore.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.4=§lFocus Effect: Rift§r<DIV>The rift focus effect should fail to work on any warded blocks. This means I should be able to deny access to an area, even if there are other Thaumaturges around who have discovered such dimensional magic.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.5=§lFocus Effect: Exchange§r<DIV>I have ensured that the exchange focus effect should not work on warded blocks. Any attempt to exchange a warded block for another will fail entirely, much like when trying to exchange any other kind of indestructible block. Thus, even if there are other practitioners of Thaumaturgy in the area, my warded areas should remain safe and secure.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.title=Focus Effect: Ward

thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.title=Discovering the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.0=I have been trying to determine if it would be possible to open a Flux Rift that doesn't lead to a swift death for quite a while now. While I think it isn't possible for me to open one myself, I have a theory that some may exist naturally in the world. However, these fractures in the fabric of reality can only occur in certain locations, where the boundaries between dimensions are weaker than normal. I should create a device that can help me locate one of these places.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.1=I have drawn up plans for a device that should be able to point me towards a dimensional fracture. By attuning a vacuous crystal with some rare earths, the crystal will react strongly to an excess of its own aspect - which just so happens to be that of the void. I also need to use a mundane material like brass for the outer casing, as using thaumium or void metal will probably make it too sensitive to get an accurate reading.<BR>Once crafted, the crystal in the device will glow if I am facing towards a fracture. The stronger the glow, the closer to the exact direction I am facing. Sadly, it appears that the Fracture Locator has a limited range. I don't have any precise measurements of exactly how far that may be, but some quick testing shows that its ability to trace the presence of vacuous drops sharply roughly at the distance where the ground meets the horizon.<BR>My calculations seem to show that space is greatly compressed in whatever place these fractures lead to, in a similar way to the Nether. Perhaps I should check there if I am having any trouble finding a fracture.

thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.title=Entering the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.0=Now that I am fairly certain dimensional fractures exist and lead somewhere, I should find and scan one of them to determine my next steps.
research.m_DIMENSIONALFRACTURE.text=Find a dimensional fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.1=My theory of natural fractures existing has proven to be correct. While it was a crucial step to entering the emptiness that lies beyond the fractures, there's one small problem. The fracture is not fully connected to the other side. Luckily, a burst of energy should be able to rip it open - which I now have the ability to create, in the form of Impetus.<BR>All I need to do is use a casting gauntlet with an attached and charged Impetus Conductor on the fracture, and after a few moments it should fully open. I have no idea what could be on the other side, although the ground around the fracture might give me some indication. Despite the possible danger, it's far too late for me to turn back now.
research.m_ENTERVOID.text=Find out what's on the other side
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.2=While I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than a dark wasteland, I still think this place can be useful to me. There are many more fractures that are close together - they must lead to areas far away from each other, as even finding a single fracture before was not so easy. It also seems that many different dimensions can lead here. I might want to see if having an alternate entrance into any of them might be useful to me.<BR>If I want to open any more fractures in the future, I only need to repeat what I first did to get here - use a casting gauntlet with an attached (and charged) Impetus Conductor on the fracture and wait a few seconds.<BR>While most of this place seems eerily quiet, I can see that the tainted areas are full of life. I should be careful when travelling through these areas, as taint can be incredibly dangerous.
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.3=Because Eldritch Guardians are tasked with guarding the places where the boundaries between dimensions are weakest, I have a feeling that they may not appreciate me opening dimensional fractures. I should be prepared to deal with unwelcome visitors around any fracture that I open.

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.title=Morphic Tool
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.0=As I continue making innovations in the world of Thaumaturgy, I find myself creating increasingly superior equipment. At the same time, while my old equipment may not match these new innovations in effectiveness, I may find their appearance to be more suitable for my personal tastes. I shouldn't have to compromise between potency and vanity - I should attempt to discover a way to create a tool that can have the appearance of one item, but the other properties, both magical and mundane, of another. Perhaps I can expand upon the Primal Crusher's unique metaphysical properties for this purpose.
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.1=I have created a method of effectively combining two items into the same space. With the help of a Primordial Pearl and a small amount of Vacuos, I can allow two items to exist in the same space, while only one is visible to outside observers. The other item is where this new Morphic Tool derives its other properties, such as strength and durability. While in this state, the decorative item is held in a state of suspension, meaning that while it cannot be damaged, it cannot interact with the world in any way.<BR>To create one of these tools, I need to set up an infusion with the item I want to keep the physical properties of in the centre, and place the decorative item on an outer pedestal (with the other requisite items of course). If I ever want to separate these two items, I only need to place the tool into a crafting grid - it seems like separating the items from each other requires substantially less energy than morphing them together.<BR>As I mentioned before, the functional item is still at risk of breaking while metaphysically bound to the decorative tool. While combined, it cannot be repaired through traditional methods. However, materials such as Void Metal will still keep their regenerative properties. I am also certain that certain more complex items will not work properly while in a Morphic Tool - while basic tools and both regular and infusion-based enchantments seem to behave, items such as armour do not.<BR>Lastly, the Morphic Tool seems to provide a slight insulating effect against warp created by the functional item. Perhaps I should revisit this phenomenon in the future to determine if I can make it more effective.

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.title=Morphic Armour
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.0=The Morphic Tool I previously created was a great success. Not only was it a breakthrough in applying the morphic properties of Primordial Pearls and Vacuos, but it also gave a purpose to my old, inferior equipment. Despite this advancement, there is still one major category of items I have not been able to use this process for - armour. I remember noting that it was too complex to keep multiple pieces of armour within the same space, without having one or both of them be disintegrated by the interdimensional forces holding them together, which I would rather not experience from the perspective of one wearing the armour. However, if I tighten the assumptions of what items are combined, then I might just be able to keep it stable enough. Making armour look like a sword is too much for it to handle, but what about two pieces of armour?
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.1=I will admit, I am somewhat surprised at my success. I knew that reducing the disparities between the states the morphic item takes would make it more stable, but I underestimated how much of a difference it actually makes. I feel as if I can say that this new Morphic Armour will allow me to safely have a set of armour be displayed to the world, while in reality wearing a different set.<BR>The process for creating Morphic Armour is very similar to that of the Morphic Tool. The central item in the infusion is the piece of armour I want to keep the properties of, while the wearable item on the outside will become the outward appearance. Beyond than this, however, there a few key differences. The infusion also takes much more Vacuos, due to needing to control a larger space (hopefully without it collapsing in on me). This also makes the infusion much more unstable.<BR>Of course, I had to make some concessions to have this work at all. While the outward appearance of any given set of Morphic Armour will work largely as designed, a few physical properties from the functional armour 'leak' into it. Unlike the Morphic Tool, I will still be able to enchant and repair the armour in its morphic state, which will be applied as normal to the functional armour. This also means that should the armour break, I will lose the decorative portion as well. I should keep a watchful eye on its durability to ensure I don't lose more items than I need to. The process of separating the items from each other, via placing the armour in an empty crafting grid, still works with the Morphic Armour. This may be a good last resort, should my armour about to break.<BR>Lastly, the warp-insulating effect of the Morphic Tool has not carried over into the Morphic Armour. This is unfortunate, given that some armour sets can contribute a considerable amount of warp, but given the propagation of other physical properties from the functional armour, this is not a huge surprise.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.title=Primal Cutter
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.0=The Primal Crusher has proven itself to be a particularly useful tool, with it essentially being four tools near-simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Crusher itself is still limited in certain areas, namely for use as a weapon, as it is rather bulky and it takes time for me to raise it back up in between swings. Even then, it is a fairly blunt instrument. However, I now wonder: would it feasible for me to apply the principle of morphic instability to a different set of tools, say, a set of cutting implements?
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.1=My theory holds true, and I have prepared a new weapon: the Primal Cutter. Like its predecessor, it is actually four morphically unstable tools all fluctuating between each other so fast that they act like one implement.<BR>The main difference between this tool and the Primal Crusher is what tools have been used in its construction, with the Cutter acting very much like both an axe and a sword. It is much lighter than the Primal Crusher, and I can swing it very fast, allowing me to deal powerful cutting strikes against my foes.<BR>This weapon kept not only the Arcing ability of the Sword of the Zephyr and the Burrowing enchantment of the Axe of the Stream, but also two more unique abilities. The simpler of the two is a powerful sapping ability - stronger than that of the Void Metal Sword. The more interesting trait gained by the Primal Cutter is the ability to draw items and creatures closer to me by continuously using the weapon. While I can think of quite a few uses for this new ability, I must also be careful - drawn entities can move quite quickly towards me, and extra durability will be consumed from the weapon while this effect is being used.<BR>By placing the weapon in a crafting grid, this drawing ability can be toggled. This can be useful if I wish to use another tool or item in my offhand.<BR>Despite their drastically different capabilities, the Primal Cutter still shares some properties with the Primal Crusher. In addition to constantly regenerating like all Void Metal materials, it has also received the Primal Crusher's disquieting nature when held for long periods, trembling in one's hand as the Void Metal morphs in between shapes imperceptibly. This will not discourage me from using it though, as it is far too useful a weapon to simply forget about.<BR>And I will §onot§r forget about it.

thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.title=Personal Flight
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.0=To freely soar through the skies is something many wish they could do, and while it is technically possible for anyone to fly directly downward after jumping off a cliff, it might be a better idea to be able to fly in the other five directions as well. I do appreciate having intact legs, after all.<BR>While I have not made much progress in utilising Thaumaturgy to induce flight in any mobile form, there are still some things I can do in the meantime. I know I will need a wearable item to attach the flying mechanisms to, unless I want my hypothetical creation to shoot off into the stratosphere without me.
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.1=I have designed a simple and relatively comfortable harness, with many buckles, straps, and connectors specifically aimed to allow the attachment of different arcane mechanisms and components. There is no point in wearing it in its current form, however, as it is simply a blank canvas for any flying devices to be built upon.<BR>With some further research, I can only imagine what different means of flight may be possible. I should take caution however, lest I become a faintly Thaumaturge-shaped crater at the bottom of a valley somewhere.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.title=Thaumostatic Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.0=My recent invention of the Arcane Levitator has provided me with a very limited type of levitation-based flight, but ever since I completed that design I have wondered whether it would be possible to apply similar principles to a portable device that allows me to freely levitate wherever I desire. Some surface-level examination has revealed that this should be possible, but not simple.<BR>I will need to study levitation further, and ways to channel Vis appropriately to produce a stable levitating force. This might require me to study some fairly obscure sources of flight firsthand, so I should take steps to ensure my research will not be abruptly ended by an unexpected fall. I believe such a source can be found in The End, where there is presumably a creature that uses a form of levitation as a specialised attack. 
research.m_LEVITATE.text=Be levitated by a creature from The End.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.1=The secrets of true levitation-based flight have been revealed to me, and I have now finalised my design for what I am calling the Thaumostatic Harness.<BR>The device operates by using stored Vis to anchor itself to the Aural Field, essentially hooking onto the ambient field the Aura creates. This will allow me to defy gravity for as long as the device has Vis. I must also continue wearing it, of course.<BR>To use the harness, I simply need to charge it with Vis, equip it as a chest bauble and jump twice while in the air. To deactivate it, I can either land on solid ground or double jump again. With the amount of Vis the device can store, I should be able to fly continuously for a few minutes. However, while the Thaumostatic Harness is active, I will be unable to refill the Vis buffer. This means I will need to either land or unequip the harness for Vis-restoring items to work properly.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.title=Thaumostatic Gyroscope
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.0=Thaumostatic flight is somewhat prone to drifting. I do not come to an immediate halt when I stop moving, which while not a major issue can be annoying at times when precision is required.<BR>It should not be too difficult for me to design an upgrade that will make flight a little more stable, probably with some additional regulators in charge of controlling movement.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.1=This new augmentation for the Thaumostatic Harness stabilizes flight greatly, preventing drift when I stop moving. These gyroscopic stabilizers carefully regulate the velocity output of the harness, ensuring that I can always come to a quick halt. Like all other augments, this upgrade can be combined with a Thaumostatic Harness by placing the harness and gyroscopes in a crafting grid, while placing an augmented harness alone in a crafting grid will remove the augment.<BR>Unfortunately, stabilized flight comes with a few downsides. The increased regulation required to allow stopping quickly also limits the maximum speed achievable with the harness, but this may not be so debilitating for precise tasks like building. I have also been forced to slightly reduce the size of the integrated Vis buffer by about 25%. However, the fact that the harness now moves more slowly should also lead to decreased Vis usage, so this may not be a problem in practice.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.title=Thaumostatic Girdle
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.0=While Thaumostatic flight is already an excellent mode of transportation, the speed of flight it provides is quite limited. I may be able to make some further adjustments to maximise the velocity output of the harness. Finding the right balance between speed and Vis cost may be a bit of a challenge, however.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.1=As expected, I have been successful in creating an upgrade for the Thaumostatic Harness that raises the maximum speed I can fly at, without compromising too much in other areas. This Thaumostatic Girdle is an additional belt that allows the harness to draw more Vis from its internal buffer at once to facilitate faster speeds. It can be attached to the harness by combining them together in a crafting grid, while placing the augmented harness alone in the grid will remove the girdle.<BR>In addition to the aforementioned increased Vis cost, the Thaumostatic Girdle makes flight much less stable, meaning I need to be careful with the large amount of drift that can occur when I stop moving. On a more positive note, I was able to increase the size of the Vis buffer by 25% and allow the harness to support sprinting while flying for even faster speeds. Using this sprint ability comes at no additional Vis cost.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.title=Elytra Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.0=In my multidimensional travels I have happened across a truly fascinating object: a pair of insectoid gliding wings. While a great deal of their origins are shrouded in mystery, I do know that these wings come from hovering ships docked at the abandoned cities in the outer islands of The End. Clearly some long-deceased race of beings once created these cities and used these wings, though whether their origins were mundane or magical is unclear to me. It makes me wonder what their relation was to the abandoned structures littering The End: were they used by scouts to protect trade ships? Wage wars with mighty floating vessels against rival cities? While I do not think I will be unlocking any major secrets about the structures, at least I have these wings to examine.<BR>This Elytra is unique in that instead of offering direct flight, it provides a surprisingly versatile means of gliding, enabling me to attain impressive speeds if I dare to push the limits of both the wings and my bravery.<BR>However, the Elytra do have a few shortcomings. First and foremost, I cannot wear them at the same time as any other chestplate or robe. They also suffer from degradation quite quickly while in use, requiring almost constant maintenance. After I become accustomed to the style of gliding these wings provide, I should be able to apply some thaumaturgical principles to solve both of these issues.
research.m_ELYTRAFLY.text=Gain some experience flying with Elytra.
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.1=I have managed to create a successful design for an upgrade to the Elytra. The flight harness I previously designed acts as the base for these upgrades, and allowed me to make quite a few improvements.<BR>Firstly, the Elytra Harness can be worn as a chest bauble, meaning I no longer have to choose between armour and gliding. Despite relocating the Elytra to this area, its mode of operation is still the same: jump while falling to begin gliding.<BR>Second, I have done a great deal to mitigate the poor durability of the original Elytra. My first modification was adding a light void metal weave throughout the wings. While they are still burdened by durability, this allows the wings to slowly repair themselves when not in use. Furthermore, I have also applied a protective ward that allows Vis to be consumed instead of damaging the wings. This protective shield only contains 50 points of Vis, and cannot be regenerated while in the air, but it can prevent any durability from being lost on shorter flights.<BR>Even with all of my improvements, it is still possible for the Elytra to break mid-flight in extreme situations. I should carefully monitor their condition to ensure I do not suddenly drop out of the sky. Thankfully, in the event this does occur, the Elytra will still be functional after they are given time to repair themselves.<BR>Lastly, I took the opportunity to allow the Elytra Harness to have a bit of a personal touch. I am able to apply any kind of banner to replace the appearance of the wings with that of the banner. This applies to mundane banners, which will apply their colour and patterns to the Elytra, but also for thaumaturgic banners, which will apply their colour and aspect insignia. For added flair, the colour of the banner will also be applied to the sparkling trail that appears as I fly.<BR>Other cosmetic items may work as an upgrade as well - there is no harm in trying to see if it does indeed work.<BR>To apply a banner or other upgrade, I just need to place it and the harness in a crafting grid. Removing the upgrade is as simple as placing the harness by itself in a crafting grid.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.title=Elytra Boosting
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.0=Despite how effective Elytra gliding can be, there is one major problem with it: it is not true flight. It requires finding a high enough point to fall from to gain a decent amount of momentum; if I am in a flat area, I am out of luck. I suppose I could use a mundane contraption with pistons and slime blocks, but that requires setup ahead of time and is not a mobile solution.<BR>I do have some inspiration to work off of, in the form of fireworks. If I am gliding and set off an ordinary firework, it will boost me a fair distance. This method is not particularly good, however. It requires large amounts of gunpowder to be sustainable, and I can only carry so many of them. Besides, any self-respecting Thaumaturge such as myself would not want to be caught resorting to such mundane measures.<BR>I considered using Vis to emulate the boosting effect of a firework, but the protective durability shield of the Elytra Harness already uses Vis, and I am uncertain that Vis would be able to produce a strong, pushing force anyway. My recent discovery of the more volatile Impetus, however, opens up some new possibilities.<BR>I will need to study mundane fireworks first, and from there I can begin the process of recreating their pushing effect with a device that uses Impetus energy. I will need to be even more cautious than usual, as I will be experimenting with both explosive gunpowder and chaotic void energy. It seems that my research always leads me to danger, no matter how mundane or magical it might be...
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.1=By emulating the explosive force of fireworks with Impetus, I can finally elevate the Elytra Harness to the level of true flight. The Impetus Thruster upgrade, as I have named it, expels stored Impetus to quickly increase my velocity in the direction I am looking.<BR>This augment can be attached and removed in the usual way: placing it with the Elytra Harness in a crafting grid to attach it, and placing the harness alone in the grid to remove it. I will also need to charge it with Impetus using one of my previously discovered methods.<BR>To activate the thruster, I only need to hold jump. To conserve Impetus, I may wish to boost in short bursts by holding down jump for short intervals, as the thruster does have a limit to how fast it can make me move.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.title=Further Golemancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.0=While I have made great strides in Golemancy thus far, sometimes working with golems can be a bit... §oinconvenient.§r I should research some ways to reduce my frustration with them.

thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.title=Autocaster
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.0=I have already had success in the creation of automated weaponry, with Automated Crossbows being rather effective for use in ranged defence. However, despite the complex magical mechanisms used in their creation, they still only fire mundane arrows (although potion-tipped arrows can create some interesting effects). I personally have the option to use a different means of ranged attack in the form of foci, so I now wonder if it is possible to automate this as well.<BR>This will not be a simple matter however, since casting even simple foci requires an understanding of the ebb and flow of the magical energies involved and knowledge of how to correctly focus Vis, both of which require an intimate connection with the aura. Making a mere machine do all of this will not be an easy task.<BR>Fortunately, it seems I am not alone in this train of thought, as my recent discovery of ruins in the Emptiness has revealed ancient automatic spell-casters held within, which I may be able to reverse-engineer in order to design my own.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.1=This was not an easy device to finalise, but with the understanding of the ancient spell-casters and with some effort spent into better connecting machines to the Aura, I have completed my plans for what I am calling the Autocaster. Reverse-engineering the ancient device was crucial here; it was quite ingeniously designed, and I now better understand how one can recreate the spiritual connection a sentient being might have to the Aura in something mechanical.<BR>As with the original Eldritch casters, it consists of a central sphere (an unusual choice in this distinctly cuboid world perhaps, but it seems to be the most optimised design) which contains most of the mechanisms. The sphere is gently levitated on a metal base, which allows it to rotate freely. I can place it on any solid floor, wall, or ceiling, and the Autocaster will immediately begin looking for targets. Because I integrated biothaumics into the design of this device, I can configure what it targets through its interface, accessible by right-clicking it.<BR>However, the device can do nothing without a focus. I can attach one through the Autocaster's menu, simply by placing it in the dedicated slot. With a focus attached and an appropriate target found, the device will begin using Vis from the local aura to cast spells at the target. If there is not enough Vis nearby it will fail to cast the spell, as would be expected. It is no Thaumaturge, however, so the foci cast are only as effective as those used in a basic Caster's Gauntlet. This also means that it will be unable to receive any augmentation to improve its casting. Much like my other automated devices, I can deactivate it by providing a redstone signal (as long as this feature is enabled in its menu), and interacting with the Autocaster while sneaking will allow me to pick it back up.<BR>Despite it not being as effective as a seasoned Thaumaturge like myself, it still can use nearly all of the focus effects that I can. Therefore, I could get very creative with how I use this device. Lastly, I should note that while I can configure what the Autocaster targets, this only determines what it will attempt to fire spells at. It will not change how the focus effect naturally behaves. For example, if I have a focus effect tuned to home in on a hostile target and the caster configured to target myself, then the spell will be fired in my direction but then may still home in on any hostile mobs that are in the area. I could create some very complex systems with this behaviour, but I should be careful to ensure that it only does what I intend it to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.2=With my discovery of focus effects that use Impetus in their casting process, I should note that the Autocaster will not be able to cast them without external assistance. This assistance can be in the form of any device capable of transferring normal, uncharged Impetus at a distance. The Autocaster can store a very small amount of Impetus in some of its Eldritch-derived components, but nowhere near the level of an Impetus Cell. I should ensure it has reliable access to Impetus to maintain continued operation.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.title=Focus Effect: Void Shield
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.0=With my recent expeditions into the Emptiness and the ruins that lie within it, I have discovered that certain particularly powerful creatures have the ability to summon magical shields that follow them around and block my attacks. They are quite effective at defending said creatures, and as such I would very much like to recreate them for myself.<BR>While I could settle for carrying around a physical shield, I would like to replicate the magical nature of the shields I saw. I will need to find a way to summon them on-demand, and I believe that I can do so via a special focus effect.<BR>In order to design this focus effect, I will need to study both the protective magic of warded arcana, but also the more esoteric area of Impetus. The former makes enough sense for this application, but I require the latter as summoning large semi-physical objects with Vis alone is very difficult. Impetus should provide enough force to be able to create tangible shields that follow me around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.1=By studying both Impetus and defensive foci, I have designed a new focus pattern that can create shields very similar to those used by the powerful entities in the Emptiness. This Void Shield focus effect uses the structured magical power of the Praecantatio aspect, and not Praemunio as I first anticipated - the latter resulted in effects that were far too static.<BR>To even use this focus effect, I will need to have Impetus available for my Caster's Gauntlet to consume, such as from a charged Impetus Conductor. Failing to have enough Impetus available will result in the shield failing to materialise.<BR>Assuming I do successfully create a shield, it will follow and protect the entity it was cast on. I can target any entity with this effect, not just myself, but missing an entity completely will result in no shield being created. If I wish to remove a summoned shield, I only need to sneak while casting the focus effect on the target. I can only remove shields that I created, however.<BR>This shield will follow its target and remain in front of their view. It will also block other creatures and projectiles from walking through it. It will never block me, and it will even allow most of my attacks to pass through unaffected. As with everything magical, however, there are always exceptions, so I should experiment ahead of time to ensure I do not accidentally damage my own shield in the heat of battle.<BR>I can control two variables relating to Void Shields in the Focal Manipulator. The first is the shield's durability, which dictates how much damage it can take before dissipating, as well as how long the shield can exist in the world for before decomposing. I also have the option of reflecting projectiles hit by the shield, causing them to bounce back in the direction they came from. Unfortunately, the shield will still take damage when reflecting projectiles.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.title=Focus Effect: Water
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.0=I have already managed to create multiple focus effects that harnessed the power of the primal elements. However, there is one that I have neglected thus far: Aqua. Although Gelum is similar, and water is generally seen as fairly benign, it may still be useful.<BR>I will need to examine water even more than I already have to better understand its potential. I have already managed to use Vis to conjure water with the Everfull Urn, so I have a good starting point for conjuring water by hand. I might need to personally study large amounts of water first hand, but as I can already create water this should be a trivial matter.
research.m_LONGTIMEINWATER.text=Spend some time in the deep depths.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.1=After a somewhat unpleasant and very soggy underwater experience, the power of water is now at my fingertips.<BR>This new focus effect will allow me to summon a torrent of water that can cool lava into solid blocks, fill water receptacles such as cauldrons and crucibles, hydrate farmland, and extinguish fires on surfaces and creatures. Fires will even be put out in a fairly large area around the area where it is cast, so I do not need to aim it directly at them. The range of this area is determined by the power of the casted focus effect. Lastly, the water will also quickly dissipate afterwards if not aimed at a liquid container, so I do not need to worry about creating floods.<BR>While this effect's usefulness in combat is limited the majority of the time, this is not true for all creatures. The fiery blaze, as an example, will find this effect to be particularly potent. On the other hand, it will completely fail to harm mobs that are native to the water, giving them a chance to breathe on land instead. I suppose this is what is to be expected from trying to drown a fish, after all.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.2=Because water evaporates almost instantly in hellish environments like the Nether, I expect the water focus to be much less effective in these areas. It should still have enough power to put out fires, but I doubt it will be able to affect anything else in the world, such as lava.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.title=Fortified Glass
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.0=There are quite a few entries in the old manuscripts covering Warded Arcana, but one of the most unique is that of Warded Glass. While ancient Thaumaturges seem to have had little trouble in creating it, the notes covering this section are obnoxiously incomplete, and such I have been unable to properly recreate the glass so far. Despite all of my efforts, I simply cannot find a way to integrate a Warding Sigil to something that is less active than a door or chest.<BR>I could perhaps study Warded Jars a little more, but they are only warded in the sense that they are resistant to certain substances or sources of damage, so I am unsure if they will provide any inspiration. I am sure I can come up with something to show for my efforts, but it may not be quite like what is described in these manuscripts.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.1=While fully warded glass has to remain a dream for now, I have come reasonably close, given the limited amount of information I had to work off of. This material I am calling Fortified Glass essentially uses the same process that I use for creating Warded Jars, but scaled up to a full block.<BR>This glass is not completely indestructible, but it is very resistant to mundane damage. Explosions, for example, should be no problem for it. I also find it is rather aesthetically pleasing, so I might be able to find a use for it in decoration.<BR>Given that I managed to create a full cubic meter of this glass, creating panes out of it is rather simple. Other than the reduced size, Fortified Glass Panes retain all of the physical properties of the original.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.title=Starfield Glass: Rift
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.0=The Void between dimensions is an inhospitable place that can hardly be called a place at all. It is hostile to life, to matter, it can house horrors I can scarcely imagine... but it is also so captivating.<BR>I cannot quite put it into words, but something about the starry void that I sometimes see as the result of dimensional manipulation is so very intriguing. Given the chance, I am sure I could spend hours simply staring into it. Something tells me I should not do this, for many say one should not gaze into such an abyss, but I really cannot help myself.<BR>Despite the allure of the Void, I would rather not have to interact too closely with such dangerous dimensional magic too often. However, it should not be too difficult to create a contained breach in dimensions that can create the same effect with none of the risks involved. Or, at least, with the risks safely contained inside a piece of Fortified Glass.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.1=Ah, this will be perfect. Fortified Glass was a great choice given my requirements, and now with only a very simple application of dimensional magic I can create Starfield Glass. I can now stare into the Void for as long as I desire, and there will be no need to work around unsafe dimensional anomalies in order to get a proper view.<BR>While it may look dangerous it is, in fact, perfectly safe, as the breach in dimensions is very weak and safely contained within the sturdy glass. It may also appear as if stepping into it would either lead one to The End or into a hostile abyss that would tear one to shreds in an instant, but I can rest assured that there is no risk of any unexpected teleportation, nor of any tears appearing in the fabric of reality from which untold chaos is invited into the world.<BR>Perfectly safe.<BR>Starfield Glass should be ideal for decorating anything I build. In fact, I believe that I may be able to make modifications to its appearance in the future. It would only involve some simple tweaks to the nature of the dimensional breach, or where precisely it leads to.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.title=Starfield Glass: Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.0=Magic mirrors of all kinds send matter through the Void between worlds in order to transport it from one mirror to another. I can see into this space by looking into a linked magic mirror of any type, but my view is limited by the edges of the frame. I would very much like to get a proper look into this space, since it seems strangely different to the Void I have seen through rifts, and with a better view I might be able to learn more about it.<BR>I have already managed to create Starfield Glass that contains a view similar to that of a rift, so with some simple modifications to the dimensional breach it should be possible to make the window look into the exact space magic mirrors lead to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.1=With only some minor adjustments to my previous Starfield Glass, I now have a new type which views the same starfield that can be seen inside magic mirrors. This variant of the glass is still perfectly safe, as the glass does not push items into a higher dimensional space like a mirror does.<BR>With this new insight gained into the space behind magic mirrors, I have learned more about its nature. From what I can tell, this space is still a Void, but it is a more compressed section of it. This unique compression of the dimensional plane allows matter to be sent through with the help of sympathetic mirror magic. While the appearance differs from that of a rift, it shares its hostility to life or anything akin to it. 

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.title=Starfield Glass: Dimensional Fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.0=With my discovery of dimensional fractures, and my recent expeditions into the Emptiness via said fractures, I have noticed that the starry sky visible in both is oddly similar and yet remarkably different to the Void visible through flux rifts. I'd quite like to get a proper look at this §ofascinating§r view... purely for research purposes, of course.<BR>This should be easy to do, as I just need to modify my previously created Starfield Glass so that it is attuned to the specific part of the Void the Emptiness exists within. It will not be stable enough to allow objects to pass through without consequences, but for visual purposes it should suffice.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.1=A trivial task really, and now I can build a new type of Starfield Glass which views the same sky that can be seen in the Emptiness and inside of dimensional fractures. As before, there is zero risk of cross-dimensional travel when stepping into it, and as such it is perfectly safe to use for decorating my lab or home.<BR>With all of these studies, I am starting to better grasp the truth of the Void. It is a very strange truth, with the Void seeming to be a paradoxical mix of nothing and yet also 'something', as empty space is still a tangible concept in itself (which can be seen by the presence of the Vacuos aspect). The exact 'something' is very chaotic, however, as it is so vague it constantly fluctuates in numerous states that act like baseline reality, like nothing and also like something completely different to reality and nothing. These fluctuations disrupt and likely destroy anything more tangible that comes into contact with them. Furthermore, the Void is so vast that, in certain sections of it, these fluctuations may balance out to a limited degree, giving these parts particular characteristics and appearances. The factors that determine these properties I do not, and perhaps cannot, fully know.<BR>It is difficult to put into words something that actively defies them, and much still perplexes me, even with my capacity for knowledge. Perhaps I should spend some time with a proper view into the Void, so I can better enlighten myself to the vastness of the Universe and that which goes beyond it. Some may accuse me of staring into space, but 'space' would imply that there is nothing to see, which in this case is evidently not true.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.title=More Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.0=With my new access to magical types of wood and stone, I may wish to make simple mechanisms out of these materials instead of their mundane counterparts. It will not be a challenge to replicate simple contraptions, such as pressure plates and buttons, with different materials.
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.1=I have designed variants of pressure plates and buttons that use my new materials instead of normal wood and stone. The new wood buttons and pressure plates can be made from either silverwood or greatwood, and they act like their oak counterparts. Arcane stone acts in a similar way to average stone.<BR>One interesting note is that I only seem to be able to create these alternate mechanism designs using an arcane workbench. Whenever I attempt to build the wooden mechanisms without it, the end results look suspiciously close to oak wood. I am not quite sure why I cannot seem to keep the distinct appearance of these materials when crafting them on my own, but I suppose I should appreciate the assistance of the arcane workbench.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.title=Arcane Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.0=Redstone mechanisms are extremely versatile and useful, even to a Thaumaturge like myself. One issue with them, however, is that I cannot control who can activate them in some cases. It is all well and good to have pressure plates handle opening my doors, until I have a monster infestation in my house. With my recent rediscovery of Warded Arcana, however, I think I can solve this problem.<BR>First of all, I think my greatwood, silverwood, and arcane stone mechanisms are good candidates for this task. Not only are they visually appealing, but their aptitude for magic should make it easier for me to ward them. The only challenge left will be making the ward allow activating the mechanisms but not otherwise affecting them, but if I was able to do this to a chest, I am sure I can do the same to these devices.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.1=I have successfully created warded versions of each of the silverwood, greatwood, and arcane stone mechanisms. They will only activate by my actions alone, ignoring those created by any other entity. If they are activated, they will produce a redstone signal in the same way as their mundane counterparts.<BR>As usual, to remove a permanently warded object, I need to sneak and interact with the object while holding a caster's gauntlet to remove it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.2=I have discovered an interesting interaction between my arcane mechanisms and arcane doors. Despite the fact that arcane doors ignore normal redstone signals, it seems that adjacent arcane mechanisms can cause them to open if activated. This will only occur if the door recognises the creature activating the mechanism as permitted, however, so I do not need to worry about someone using this property to bypass my Arcane Doors. I should also note that this only applies to the immediate area around the mechanisms - they are not able to be transferred over distances like redstone signals.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.title=Exploring the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.0=There is more to the Emptiness than I have once expected. One might assume a world so close to the Void could not be anything but a barren wasteland, but alongside the areas infested with taint there is §osomething§r that sets my teeth on edge. Something that has pierced its way in this place like a splinter in the skin of the dimensional boundaries. I cannot be too surprised, as reality here is far more malleable due to the many fractures that have been made in it, and how one wrong step can send me tumbling into an inhospitable abyss. With reality that unstable, it was almost guaranteed that some malicious influence would appear or otherwise make its way here - if they were not here from the beginning.<BR>For a while now, I have slowly been coming to the realisation that the Eldritch may refer to far more than a branch of Thaumaturgy, or to knowledge that can twist one's mind with Warp. The Crimson Rites, in particular, was filled with uses of the phrase 'The Eldritch' in ways that would put it far above that, in a way that would suggest that merely knowing that such things exist is something reserved to those who are destined to go beyond the mundane world I have come to know. To them, uttering the phrase must be almost blasphemous, something that no ordinary being should ever be allowed to do, let alone a Thaumaturge such as myself.<BR>No, the Eldritch cannot simply refer to this branch of magic centered around the Void. Instead, I believe it refers to a race of beings that have existed for a very, very long time, and who have had an effect on the world that has shaped much of what I treat as fact, or as being perfectly normal. If they exist, it could explain many of the oddities I have discovered, particular quirks in magical principles, why certain creatures are present in the world, and how some can lose their minds so utterly that they form sects made entirely of madmen dedicated to a ritual that can do nothing good.<BR>If I am to fully understand any of this, I will have to explore the Emptiness further, to discover what exactly is causing this disturbance in the aura. This Eldritch influence will almost certainly be hostile to something as comparatively small as myself, but the path to knowledge often involves risk, and I cannot turn back now. Not with the power that such knowledge may offer me.
research.m_ENTERSPIRE.text=Discover something peculiar in the Emptiness.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.1=I have found something in the Emptiness. Ruins, ancient, created and placed here for a reason I do not know, although I am certain it is the work of the Eldritch. I can feel the disturbance in the surrounding magic field very strongly here, so this is precisely what I was looking for. Or, perhaps, these ruins contain what I am looking for.<BR>The ruins themselves are made up of many different parts, a series of chambers built around a central spire. At the bottom of this spire are a set of unusual doors, constructed using a form of magic that I am not entirely familiar with, although I do recognise the the presence of dimensional magic within their mechanisms. The lock at their centre seems to be a receptor for something, and I believe impetus might be the key. A charged impetus conductor attached to a caster's gauntlet should suffice - I only need to use it on the lock to open the door and unleash whatever lurks inside.<BR>While I cannot find out more until I enter the ruins, one important thing I have noticed is that a powerful protective ward is being held upon these ruins, likely by a powerful force within them. Until I enter these ruins and destroy the source of this power, I will be unable to break my way through the dungeon. Some chunks of stone seem to have been damaged over time, however, and the ward seems to have faded from these locations. In the event I find any of these weakened segments blocking my path, I should be able to break them freely.<BR>Given the size, complexity, and unnerving feel of these ruins, whatever lurks within them will almost certainly pose a threat to me. If I am not properly prepared for a fight, I should probably head back home and make preparations before I continue. Having come so far, it would truly be a shame to die now at the hands of that which I am trying so hard to fully understand.
research.m_BOSSROOM.text=Uncover the secrets of the Eldritch Spire.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.2=This room... this altar... §oI have seen this before!§r Pages within the Crimson Rites held drawings, within which were depicted such strange things, all around an altar just like this one! I can see that this is the very heart of the spire, it holds the protective ward in place and corrupts the aura around it. However, the altar is unbreakable, so I must find another way to stop its influence.<BR>...I know what I must do. Apertis Oculis. I must Open the Eye of the altar. I know very little about the ritual, so little that I do not know what will happen once I perform it, but I can see that the altar is fully prepared, so all I need to do is use my Casting Gauntlet on the central pedestal to cast the final invocation.<BR>I should prepare for what happens next, whatever that may be. Something powerful is watching me here. I can feel it.
research.m_ELDRITCHBOSS.text=Open the Eye and discover what it sees.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.3=When I performed the ritual, Apertis Oculis, at the altar, I was not sure what I was expecting to happen. Perhaps I thought it would have simply stopped the spire's influence on the area around it. Really, I should have known better.<BR>The powerful being that appeared from the portal was the true source of the ruins' corruption, the altar was merely an anchor for it to hold onto across the dimensional planes. However, after forcing it into the Emptiness via the ritual I was able to kill it, and I can feel that the dimensional boundaries have stabilized somewhat, meaning that the protective ward that previously stopped me from damaging the structure has also dissipated. If I wish to do so, I can more freely explore the ruins and mine the various blocks that make them up; I may be able to find some additional trinkets and collect a nice variety of new building materials for me to use.<BR>Aside from that, I discovered something interesting that the spire's apparent curator left behind: a set of tattered scrolls. I do not know why the being dropped them nor how such ancient scrolls have managed to survive intact, but after scanning them I can see that they contain knowledge incredibly useful to me, most likely about Auromancy and Impetus. These will be the key to my continued research; I shall write about them more in a further entry.<BR>Despite my success in stopping the malicious force that these ruins held, I can sense that the aura in the Emptiness is still twisted. I am certain that other Eldritch Spires may be found there, each containing another ritual altar anchoring another malevolent being to it. If I so wish, I can repeat what I have already done and fight my way through them. While this will be tiring, I will almost certainly gain more useful trinkets and resources. For future reference, the first door of the spire is opened with impetus cast from a gauntlet, the various other doors are opened with keys found throughout other parts of the spire, and the ritual altar in the final room can be forced to summon the spire's master by using my casting gauntlet on it.<BR>After all of this, I am left with some questions though. What is the true purpose of these spires? Why do they hold such a variety of trinkets and resources? Will I find further copies of these ancient scrolls in different spires? What are these beings, and how have they become so powerful? I believe it is no accident that I found these notes... but I must continue my research. I must.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.title=Eldritch Epiphany
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.0=I have made excellent progress with translating the ancient scrolls, and while what I have learned is perhaps not what I expected, it is precisely what I needed. As I suspected, the parts I translated cover two main areas of magic: Auromancy and Impetus. I shall cover each area separately.<BR>Firstly, Auromancy. This was one of the areas of translation that confused me the most, and for a very good reason: it seems that the aura of the distant past was quite different than the one I am familiar with. The aura in its current state is a field of magical energy, vis, that exists in higher dimensions and which permeates through many dimensional planes in fluctuating amounts. Certain areas and dimensions have weaker dimensional boundaries thus more vis is able to seep in, and the inverse is equally true. However, these scrolls reveal that the aura was not always like this, and that the connection to the other side was once far more tangible and focused, semi-physically present in the form of §l'Aura Nodes'.§r Vis would have to be directly drawn from these nodes in order to cast spells or operate devices, instead of drawing it from the surrounding area. Furthermore, the vis would come naturally attuned to different aspects, as opposed to having to manually attune the vis via essentia crystals or foci. This explains some of the oddities in design I noticed about the older wands I abandoned in favour of my gauntlets: they were designed for a very different version of the aura.<BR>Something very clearly happened to the aura nodes, and based on some rough theory working I have performed I can ascertain that they dispersed over a very long period of time. Initially, they spread out to a limited degree, with nodes feeding the surrounding area with different types of vis (meaning that at this period of time drawing vis directly from nodes for use in magic was not viable, and instead it was drawn from the area like I do now). Eventually, this dispersion became so severe that the nodes vanished entirely, leaving only numerous tiny invisible dimensional cracks from which pure non-attuned vis could flow through. However, I am fearful as to what may have induced this process. At first I thought it might have been a natural process, the aura gradually evolving over the aeons, but this does not seem right. There are, however, some strong hints at a true answer revealed by the next section.<BR>Secondly, the scrolls provided some tantalising hints about impetus and how I might be able to better manipulate it. Notably, the text in this section of the notes is hastily scrawled, and the tone within seems to be far more urgent. While the writer seemed perplexed as to the nature of impetus (a feeling I can attest to), they did manage to provide me with a formula for a specialised jewel that can effectively resonate impetus energy, which should allow me to properly focus, transport and use it. In essence, I should be able to transmit impetus in the form of energy beams, given some extra research.<BR>I was a little puzzled as to the somewhat contradictory nature of the ancient mage's understanding of impetus though, since they had struggled to find a way to create impetus reliably despite their knowledge of how to properly focus and transmit it. However, I now believe they were able to easily channel impetus because they already had familiarity with using the ancient form of vis in a similar fashion, transporting it as energy beams via crystal relays, and thus they already had a starting point to use for impetus. But as for their inability to summon it, this implies something far more sinister.<BR>The only reason I can see for an accomplished ancient Thaumaturge being unable to reliably create impetus is that they did not have access to all of the magical phenomena that I do. If the nature of vis and the aura has changed over the aeons, then might that mean the nature of flux has never been fully consistent either? The presence of aura nodes would almost certainly have a big impact on how it would behave, and while I am not sure, I think the creation of flux rifts might not have been possible in their presence. If this is true, then there would be no reliable way to summon impetus energy, and thus an ancient Thaumaturge would have to rely on some other, likely far more dangerous, means of obtaining it.<BR>This troubles me. If flux rifts are a recent phenomenon, at least in terms of the vast timescales that entire universes operate by, then might this mean that something is forcefully attempting to shape reality in order to enable their creation? While this could be an entirely natural process, something about this all strikes me as so utterly twisted. What is happening to the aura to make it so… §ocorrupt?§r If some malicious force wanted the creation of flux rifts to be possible, then perhaps it would explain the ancient aura nodes' gradual disappearance, since without them there is nothing to prevent flux rifts from opening in high flux areas. But if this is all true, then why would this force want flux rifts to be opened at all, and how would it be able to manipulate the aura so entirely so to make aura nodes vanish? Do dimensional fractures and the Emptiness play a part here perhaps?<BR>I am loath to fully admit it, but if this is all true then I can only think of one force powerful enough to induce such a change in our world. The Eldritch. §oThey§r want something with our world, with those who occupy it, with the Crimson Cult, with me, but I do not know what that is. I don't even know if I would be able to fully comprehend the answer if it was right in front of me. But I must continue my research nonetheless, because with this discovery I have been granted a great potential for power, and I know I can use this power to bend reality as I see fit. §oThey§r will not stop me. Some might say they would travel to Hell and back to see their goals through, but the Nether is nothing next to the places I have been to, all to further my understanding of the forces that underlie magic.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.title=Expanded Impetus
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.0=With the wisdom I have gained from the scrolls of old, I believe I am now ready to fully unlock the potential of impetus. Previously I was able to use it to create void seeds, and after that collect and store it through manual use of a caster's gauntlet, but with only a little more research I should be able to use the turbulent forces of the Void to do a great deal more than that.<BR>I already have a recipe for what is known as an Impetus Jewel, and while I know what it does in theory, I must now actually create one to see how it behaves in practice. The jewel, however, will only be capable of resonating impetus to receive and transmit it directly; therefore, I still need a way to draw impetus out of a flux rift in the first place. Fortunately, I have already done this previously, firstly with a Void Siphon and secondly with an Impetus Conductor. The former seems more appropriate a starting point for what I am aiming for, that being automatic collection of raw impetus. However, a Void Siphon requires a nether star, so I should probably endeavour to find a way to avoid needing them at all.<BR>Despite the effort this will take, these next steps will still be far simpler than getting past the dead-end I faced previously. At least I now have all of the fundamental knowledge required to actually do this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.1=Now. Now I can truly begin to use impetus.<BR>Using the schematics I had previously created for the Void Siphon, I was able to modify the design so I could create the fundamental devices that can automatically collect, transport, resonate and distribute impetus. I shall cover how can one properly set up an impetus power system, and to do this I shall break it all down into separate parts that cover the different concepts, tools and devices involved.<BR>Before I begin, however, I feel I must note that when it comes to learning something new, more often than not the best way to understand something is to experiment with it physically. I should also note that impetus is complex topic for one to understand, and I would not be surprised if I happen to forget certain parts or get confused about impetus power mechanisms. Thus, if I am at all confused by what I am detailing, I might find it helpful to create and experiment with a few simple impetus energy setups so to better understand the principles involved firsthand. I suppose that I will have to see whether I prefer careful study or practical experimentation in order to fully understand this complicated and dangerous topic.<PAGE>§lCharged Impetus§r<DIV>Previously I only had access to impetus fairly indirectly, through the void seeds it created and the impetus stored in conductors attached to gauntlets. But with my new discoveries I am now able to gather impetus in a different more energetic form. I am calling this new form of impetus 'Charged Impetus'. I shall cover the distinction between the two.<BR>Normal impetus can be seen as lines of starry void trailing through the air, and is usually directly pulled from a flux rift. It is what I have been using up until now and is what void siphons and impetus conductors use. Devices accessing normal impetus tend to be able to idly draw it from an impetus source, again, this usually being in the form of a flux rift. Notably, it is harmless for one to touch normal impetus trails… at least, probably, but they do at least seem to pass through me without any damage done.<BR>Charged impetus, however, is more volatile and therefore has a great deal more potential use. By making it take this charged form, I can transfer larger amounts of impetus over longer distances. It is what will power my planned specialised machinery, and can be seen in the world as beams of energy, which vary from faint to bright depending on how much charged impetus is being sent through them. Another difference from normal impetus is that charged impetus must be specifically directed to devices that use it, as opposed to drawing it from a nearby rift. I shall detail later on in this entry how to create charged impetus.<BR>For the sake of safety, I should note that an active beam of charged impetus has enough compacted energy to be rather deadly, and if I am caught between one then I will be hurt. Inactive beams, however, are safe. An inactive beam can be seen as faint wisps of energy, while an active beam glows bright and can be clearly seen.<PAGE>§lImpetus Nodes§r<DIV>Blocks placed in the world that connect to beams of charged impetus are collectively referred to as 'impetus nodes'. To clarify: they have no relation to aura nodes. It does not matter whether a device creates, uses, or simply transfers charged impetus, if it connects to charged impetus beams in one form or another then it is classified as an impetus node.<BR>Impetus nodes have set numbers of input and output slots, which dictate how many beams of charged impetus can feed into and be sent out of them. Impetus nodes, therefore, can be designed so to transfer energy from one to the other, so a source of charged impetus can output energy into a node, and this node can output energy into another node, and so on and so forth. Different nodes have different numbers of input and output slots, for instance a device that creates charged impetus will only have output slots, a device that transfers charged impetus will have both inputs and outputs, and a device that uses charged impetus will only have input slots.<PAGE>§lImpetus Resonator§r<DIV>With impetus nodes having been detailed, there still needs to be a way to define how impetus nodes are connected to one another. For such a purpose, I have designed the Impetus Resonator.<BR>The Impetus Resonator is a tool which can modify the connections an impetus node has. By holding the device in hand and then sneaking and right-clicking an impetus node of any kind, said node will be clearly highlighted in blue and selected for modification. If I sneak right-click the same node again, it will be deselected.<BR>With an impetus node selected, I can then connect it to another node by right-clicking without sneaking on said other node. By doing this, the first node has been set to output energy into the second one, taking up an output slot on the first node and an input slot on the second. If I right-click the second node again, then the connection will be removed. To send energy from one node into multiple other ones, then I simply select the first node via sneak right-click and then right-click all the other nodes one-by-one. I should keep in mind the slot limitations when doing this, however. Also of note is that impetus beams can only travel so far, at a distance of around eight meters, and they cannot travel through opaque walls. Glass or other transparent materials will permit impetus beams to pass through them, however. I will need to ensure that impetus nodes are kept fairly close together and that they are not obstructed by walls in order to link them together properly.<BR>If I select an impetus node that already has connections defined, then I can also see these connections visualised. Any nodes that feed impetus into the selected node are highlighted in red, and any nodes the selected node sends impetus out to are highlighted in green. In the special case of a node being both an input and output of the selected node, it will be highlighted in purple. If I am at all uncertain, I can also see in which direction impetus will travel based on which direction the beams are flowing.<BR>While the Impetus Resonator can define how nodes are connected to one another, very little will happen if no charged impetus is actually being fed into the system, which is where the Impetus Drainer comes in.<PAGE>§lImpetus Drainer§r<DIV>The Impetus Drainer is an important impetus node that creates charged impetus energy when placed next to a flux rift. Based on the Void Siphon, it has a dense piece of void metal on top which draws in normal impetus (fortunately, the nether star was not needed here, since the siphon's only use for it is to coalesce normal impetus into void seeds), and using a rotating mechanism it charges the impetus and transmits it into an impetus jewel at its centre. It can therefore be seen as the heart of a charged impetus generation system. When the Drainer draws impetus out of a rift, the rift in question will gradually begin to shrink and become unstable, as with the Void Siphon. Draining a smaller rift will result in it drawing less impetus than if the rift was larger. Therefore, I should ensure that I keep an eye on the rift I am draining to ensure that it remains stable and sizeable.<BR>The device itself has one impetus beam output slot and no inputs, since it creates charged impetus. Therefore, to send energy out of it and into other impetus nodes, I only need to sneak right-click it with the Impetus Resonator and then right-click on the other nodes in question.<BR>If I wish to disable the device, I only need to provide it with a redstone signal. This will stop the device from draining any nearby rifts and from creating impetus, so I can use this to ensure that I do not drain a flux rift too much.<PAGE>§lImpetus Relay§r<DIV>Probably the simplest type of impetus node, the Impetus Relay is simply a way to transport beams of impetus from one place to another. It has two input slots and two output slots, so I have some room to tinker with routing in my energy transport systems.<PAGE>§lImpetus Diffuser§r<DIV>This device can be seen as the inverse of the Impetus Drainer, since it takes in charged impetus and diffuses normal impetus from the top. Therefore, it can be used to power any devices that drain flux rifts directly, such as gauntlets with impetus resonators attached or void siphons. It has one input slot and no output slots, since it is a device that consumes charged impetus.<BR>I should note that the Diffuser cannot power the Impetus Drainer, since that could create feedback problems where normal impetus is converted to charged impetus, which is converted back to normal via the diffuser, which is then is sent back into the drainer which converts it to charged, which is sent back to the diffuser, etc.<BR>Of note is that using this device to power normal impetus devices will in fact be better for them than having them drain a rift directly. The charging process actively improves the efficiency of impetus creation, so it should be well worth the effort to use my new impetus power systems even with my older machines.<BR>As with the Drainer, I can turn the device off with a redstone signal, which will therefore prevent it from powering normal impetus devices.<BR>This covers the basics of charged impetus power systems. Despite my progress, I know that I have much more to learn and create, both with devices that transmit impetus but also those that use it.<BR>There is so much potential here, my mind is spinning with so many possibilities…

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.title=Impetus Gate
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.0=Charged impetus power networks are already a rather complex topic to understand completely, consisting of many parts beyond just connecting nodes together. At the moment, I have no way to restrict the power transfer between two nodes without permanently severing the connection between them. This limitation exists due to the fact that I have not found a reasonable way to block an impetus beam within an impetus node itself; I can only redirect the beam.<BR>Normally, I would turn to redstone, as it excels at inhibiting magic. However, even redstone cannot fully inhibit a charged impetus beam, as the magical energy is just far too concentrated for it to handle. Thankfully, my studies into warding arcana may prove useful here. The protective magic that it covers could be indirectly used to "protect" something like an impetus relay from receiving a charged power beam, with this protective behaviour being adjustable within the device itself. I'll need to study this further in order to get the exact behaviour I need.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.1=I have confirmed that with some careful combination warded arcana and mundane redstone, it is possible to temporarily block charged impetus beams as I desired. When no redstone signal is given to the device, it acts as a normal impetus relay. When the redstone signal is applied, the protective shield enters a semi-solid state and prevents charged impetus from passing through in either direction. If the signal is removed, the shield will quickly dissipate and charged impetus can pass through as normal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.title=Impetus Matrix
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.0=The charged impetus power I have discovered does have a great deal of future potential, being more volatile and immediately powerful than vis, and more flexible than the standard form of impetus I have used in the past. However, one major limitation of dealing with impetus in large amounts is the fact that it cannot be stored in any capacity after it has been extracted. Simply treating a flux rift as an impetus battery will only get me so far, as I have to work around the rift's precarious stability, not to mention the inability to extract more controlled amounts of impetus from it. Therefore, a means of storing larger quantities of impetus in a safe, or at least safer, manner would be ideal.<BR>I have already had success in storing small amounts of normal impetus. Looking at it from a wider perspective, I have done it through a fair few ways: in an impetus conductor for use in a casting gauntlet, in its coalesced and semi-physical form of a void seed, and most importantly inside a purpose-built impetus cell. These methods are all viable for normal impetus because while impetus itself is always volatile, it is nowhere near the levels of charged impetus. The crux of the problem is finding a way to keep it from growing too unruly while in storage, while also keeping it readily accessible at a moment's demand.<BR>After some time spent pondering this dilemma, I believe I might be able to achieve this. From what I can tell, unstable charged impetus is rather similar to the instability one can experience in a poorly maintained infusion process. When I was perfecting the art of infusion, I created the runic matrix to help regulate and stabilize infusions, and I think I may be able to reuse it in order to safely contain charged impetus. The exact implementation will almost certainly differ, of course, but I am confident that the idea is sound in principle.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.1=I originally spent a great deal of time and effort designing a way to manage complex arcane infusions. It seems that even after meeting its initial goal, that effort has lead to a breakthrough yet again. Combined with a retaining structure similar to the aura node management devices of old, I have created a device I am calling the Impetus Matrix. Despite this not being the first time I have retrofitted an ancient design related to these nodes to support impetus, I am still left wondering if there is something greater hiding in the similarities between the two systems. I will make a mental note to return to this train of thought at a later date, for the Impetus Matrix deserves my immediate attention.<BR>To create an Impetus Matrix, I need to place a runic matrix between two eldritch pedestals, with one pedestal above and the other below the matrix. As with all mystical constructs, I need to use a pinch of Salis Mundus to form the full structure, and breaking any individual piece will revert it back to its discrete components.<BR>Once assembled, the Impetus Matrix requires some additional preparation to begin storing charged impetus. Firstly, impetus cells need to be inserted into the pedestals to act as the main storage receptacle. To insert a cell, I simply need to use it on the side of the pedestal I wish to insert it into. Each pedestal can hold up to four cells, one per side, for a maximum of eight total cells. The Matrix will be functional with even only a single cell. However, adding more cells will allow the Impetus Matrix to contain more charged impetus, as well as transfer more of that impetus in and out of the Matrix over a shorter period of time. Should I wish to remove a cell, I need to use the pedestal with an empty hand on the side containing the cell. Unfortunately, any excess impetus the remaining cells cannot store will be lost when doing this, so I should take care to not be wasteful.<BR>Secondly, the Matrix will need to be stabilized. When charged impetus is stored within the matrix, it will gradually begin to lose stability, with this stability loss growing as more charged impetus is stored. To stop this stability loss, I simply need to place the same occult paraphernalia that I use for the same purpose near infusion altars. The stability zone of the Impetus Matrix is smaller than that of the infusion altar, encompassing a five by five meter area. I still need to ensure that the objects are placed in symmetrical patterns around the central point of the Matrix, unless I want it to be even more unstable than without the objects. The same occurrence of diminishing returns as I place the same kind of object occurs with the Impetus Matrix, so I may need to obtain many different items to store large amounts of charged impetus.<BR>Should the Impetus Matrix ever become unstable, it will begin to induce unpleasant effects around it, much like unstable infusions. It may discharge some of the stored impetus as bolts of harmful energy, knock impetus cells out of the pedestal, among some other harmful effects. Fortunately, the instability of an Impetus Matrix is less potent than that of an infusion, given the fact that it is not regulating an active crafting process with constant barrages of magical energy. This means that I will not need as many objects to have the Matrix reach a stable state as I might need for an infusion altar. I can also see the total stability gain and loss, as well as the approximate stability state, of the Impetus Matrix by looking at the central Runic Matrix with a pair of Goggles of Revealing.<BR>Finally, after following all of these steps, the Impetus Matrix will be ready to safely store charged impetus. The usual method of using an Impetus Resonator to direct impetus beams into and out of the Matrix applies here, with it being able to accept one input and one output. The coloured runes on the matrix will show a rough approximation of how full the attached impetus cells are. Red represents a completely empty Matrix, yellow is partially filled, and bright green runes signify it being full. I can also attach a redstone comparator to any part of the Impetus Matrix to create a redstone signal that corresponds to the same information.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.title=Impetus Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.0=Long-distance transfer of charged impetus is a bit of a problem for me at the moment; because impetus beams can only travel a set distance, I need a great amount of relays and patience to link far away nodes together. There has to be a better way to go about doing this than the brute-force approach.<BR>Long distance transfer is something I have already successfully done with magic mirrors, but only with items and aerated essentia. It should be possible to use the same method to remotely connect impetus beams from one mirror to another, but it will require some special modifications to prevent the impetus from being ripped out of its concentrated, charged form. Since magic mirrors send materials through some corner of the Void, the impetus will naturally want to escape the mirrors and return to the realm it is more familiar with.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.1=Despite the unusual nature of impetus, I have successfully managed to apply the principles of mirror magic to it, and I now have access to long-distance charged impetus transfer in the form of the Impetus Mirror. The mirror's design has obviously had to go under some adjustment, and therefore requires some more esoteric materials to craft it, but despite this it functions very similarly to any other kind of magic mirror.<BR>To use the mirror, I first need to create the usual pair of mirrors, place one in the world and use the second mirror on the placed one, linking the two together. I then simply place the second mirror at another location, and charged impetus beams can be sent through them. As with other magic mirrors, this link works across any distance and even across dimensions. However, the usual phenomenon of time seeming to stand still in places I am far away from still applies, so I will need to either be near the mirrors or set up a device to counteract this effect if I want two mirrors that are very far away from each other to link.<BR>I can use the Impetus Resonator to connect inputs and outputs to the mirrors like any other node. Each mirror has a single input and output available for my use. This is separate from the intrinsic connection between two linked mirrors, which is effectively a bidirectional impetus link between them.<BR>While I am overall very pleased with the flexibility the mirrors offer me, they have a few limitations. The speed of impetus transfer had to be capped to prevent it from being torn apart in the Void, so I may need to be a bit more clever if I need high-throughput transfer. These mirrors also place the same strain on the aura as the other types of mirrors do, so frequently using the mirrors to transfer impetus will cause it to generate flux at both mirrors. Lastly, mirrors are much more expensive to craft than something comparatively simple like an Impetus Relay, so I should try to intelligently design my impetus setups to minimise their usage.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.title=Rift Management
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.0=As my usage of flux rifts increases, the rifts themselves seem to be fighting back. Not unexpected for a volatile tear in the fabric of magic, but I need to find ways to better manage them. An unstable rift is incredibly dangerous, prone to destroying whatever is around it.<BR>Before I begin investigating means of managing rifts, however, I shall first compile some notes on their behaviour I have noticed while working with them.<BR>Rifts form when too much flux appears in the local aura, around three-fourths of the total vis cap to be precise - a fact that I learned the hard way. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can faintly see the rift through the terrain, so if a rift appears in an unknown location I can use those to help locate it. The rift will continue to absorb the excess flux in the aura, growing in size as it does so. However, if there is no more flux to sustain the rift, it will become more and more unstable. There is also a point where even in the presence of flux, the rift cannot sustain its growth. This effectively sets a maximum size that rifts that naturally grow to.<BR>I have also observed some interesting characteristics about a rift's stability. A rift gains stability from absorbing flux, or, in its absence, by inducing an instability event to expunge some of its unstable energy. I can also stabilize a rift with the redstone-based stabilizers I created for use in infusion. Using a stabilizer like this does present a problem in that it generates more flux than a single rift consumes, but I suppose it will have to do until I devise a better method for stabilizing rifts.<BR>One way of identifying a rift's stability at a glance is through its movement. A perfectly stable rift will appear to be perfectly stationary, but as it loses stability it will begin pulsing and shifting. If the rift starts releasing small wisps of energy, it has reached the point where it will create chaotic disruptions at any moment. I believe that these wisps are the rift discharging its unstable energies, with this energy coming from the chaotic Void on the other side of the rift which is "shaped" by the rift into unpleasant flux-related chaos.<BR>Instability effects vary, but they are unpleasant and potentially lethal. One of the most common events is the rift condensing the flux into a physical form, namely through a taint seed. If the seed is not quickly removed, the area around it will become a flux-filled mess, potentially setting off a chain reaction of more rifts forming. Other events include the release of proper wisps, the ones that zap anything that comes too close, as well as clouds of flux forming in the vicinity. In rare circumstances, the rift may naturally collapse, sealing the breach in reality on its own. This is the same process that is induced by a causality collapser, but occurs so infrequently that it probably is not worth waiting for.<BR>Finally, I should note that a flux rift's connection to the Void means that it interacts with physical matter in destructive ways. Flux rifts are capable of consuming all but the most durable of materials if they grow into them, not even leaving an item behind. Living matter will similarly be quickly destroyed on contact.<BR>With these behaviours documented, I believe I am now prepared to design some tools to better manage these rifts. Despite how dangerous they are, I know that they are crucial to my continued attempts to unlock all of the secrets Thaumaturgy has to offer.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.title=Void Recharge Pedestal
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.0=Since I now have access to more handheld or portable items that use impetus in their operation, I should look into better methods to supply them with that impetus. Currently I can use the Impetus Diffuser to charge them up, but there are two major downsides to using it: firstly that the diffuser outputs only a very slow trickle of impetus into items, taking a long time to charge them up fully, and secondly it can only charge items that I am either holding out in my hand or that I have equipped on my person. These problems are the result of the diffuser outputting normal impetus in the area around it, so if I were to design a method of charging items up with a more direct beam of charged impetus then it would almost certainly limit these prior issues.<BR>At first I was a little lost about where to start with this task, but after some thinking I believe I can use my old Recharge Pedestal as a starting point. Vis and impetus have some interesting similarities, and the old notes I found referenced methods of using the long-forgotten node-drawn CV in order to charge thaumaturgy's ancient wands. With these two pieces of knowledge in mind, I believe I can create a new form of Recharge Pedestal that takes in a beam of charged impetus and rapidly charges any items placed on top of it.<BR>Hopefully I can create something good out of this, I'd rather not have to sit next to a diffuser for any longer than I have to, especially considering that even the faint trails of impetus make me somewhat... §ouneasy.§r
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.1=The Void Recharge Pedestal is now ready to be built, and it should be far better for charging individual items with impetus than the diffuser I've only had access to up until now. I've taken the basic design of the standard Recharge Pedestal, replaced the standard magical components with more Void-related ones and tweaked the piece on top so it can better channel impetus energy.<BR>When built and placed in the world, I can prepare the new pedestal simply by directing a beam of charged impetus energy into it (using the Impetus Resonator as normal), and then once any empty or partially filled impetus using items are placed into the pedestal a beam of impetus energy will be fed into the item. The item should charge far, far more rapidly than with the diffuser, although I should make sure not to step into the active beam of impetus while I charge the item.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.title=Impulse Cannon
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.0=With the secrets of impetus power being gradually revealed to me, I believe it is time to put them to use in a somewhat... unsubtle manner. Impetus is naturally more volatile than vis, and after some pondering I am left with a grim yet intriguing question: what if I were to try and weaponize it?<BR>Initially, I thought it might be possible to do this via a focus effect, where the effect would channel impetus from a connected impetus conductor and unleash it as destructive energy. However, it would require great concentration on my part. Even the slightest lapse in attention would result in the impetus backfiring, destroying the focus before killing me, no doubt in a very unpleasant way. Additionally, even if such a focus posed no danger to me, the impetus conductor is a low-power device that is not suitable for the large burst of impetus that a weapon directly harnessing it requires.<BR>All of these problems are the result of me trying to apply an entirely new source of power to a casting method not inherently designed to accommodate it. If I were to instead build a device that can properly contain, stabilize, and fire the impetus, then I will almost certainly have far more success. I will also not be reduced to a pile of ashes drifting gently away from a smouldering crater.<BR>I unfortunately see no better trial to determine if this idea has merit than subjecting myself to the touch of a charged impetus beam. I have previously noted that the beams travelling between relays can damage living creatures, so if I have not already (whether deliberately or as a result of a mishap), I should touch one of them. It also must be in the process of transferring charged impetus, as the passive beams between nodes are harmless. I should also prepare some devices capable of stabilizing magic - I have the feeling that I will need them.
research.f_IMPETUSDAMAGE.text=Feel the sting of charged Impetus
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.1=§oThis...§r this may very well be my magnum opus. The plans laid out before me fill me with a strange mixture of emotions: awe, intrigue, horror… perhaps even wonder. I am ready to create what may be one of the most dangerous and powerful devices that can be made with the disciplines of thaumaturgy, which I have called the Impulse Cannon. It uses the raw force of impetus and unleashes it as a deadly beam of energy, which can deal impressive amounts of damage to anything it catches.<BR>The design of the cannon itself took rather a lot of work in order to finalise, and even then the result is a touch unrefined; despite its potential for power, it is still something of an experimental weapon. As an overall description of how it works, the device stores impetus within the main body at the back of it, and then sends it through the central focusing chamber underneath a strip of redstone inlay. This inlay is stabilized by a miniature infusion stabilizer that steadies the beam. The impetus is then transmitted through a modified casting focus at the tip, which fires a continuous beam of energy. I then augmented the design with a grip and firing trigger underneath the main body, a handle on the focusing barrel, and a stock at the back so that I can properly hold it. With all this in mind, the device requires a lot of advanced components and materials to fully build, with the final assembly process being a very dangerous arcane infusion, so if I am to build it then I should be aware of the difficulty and potential danger that lies ahead.<BR>If I do create an Impulse Cannon, then to properly use it I first need to charge it up with impetus energy. Once charged, I then hold the cannon and simply use it in order to fire it. The beam that it creates goes a fair distance, and deals continuous damage to any monster, animal or otherworldly horror that it touches. The power of the Void does not discriminate in what it harms, and will also cut through armour to a limited extent. As one would expect, the stored impetus within the device is quite rapidly used up when the beam is fired, and I can see how much impetus is left within it by either looking at the device in my inventory or by looking at a gauge on the device while I hold it.<BR>As a final note, I have also made sure the device is open to further modification in future, and thus there is the potential for further augmentation in order to change how the device operates. Notably, the focusing chamber is very modifiable, so I could change how the cannon fires the beam of impetus energy.<BR>Such a powerful weapon. I cannot let it fall into the wrong hands. §oIt should be mine alone to use.§r

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.title=Impulse Cannon: Railgun Conversion
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.0=The Impulse Cannon in its current state is a very effective weapon, although there are some limitations to the beam it creates. The damage output is good, but it does not instantly rip things apart as I hoped, and furthermore it can only travel so far before the beam cannot sustain itself and promptly dissipates.<BR>However, since I have left the cannon open for further modification, I may be able to create an augment that changes how it fires. In this particular case, I think I might have some success with firing a set amount of energy all in one go, as opposed draining a continuous amount for a consistent beam. To do this, I will need to modify the central focusing chamber with an additional lens. This shouldn't be too hard to do, especially since the bulk of the work with actually creating the cannon itself is all done.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.1=I have completed my work on this particular augment for the Impulse Cannon. This augment changes how the device fires quite radically, so calling it a 'conversion kit' seems more appropriate.<BR>This kit, called the Railgun Conversion Kit, converts the cannon into a weapon that fires a single beam of energy in one go, which travels further than the ordinary beam, does a great deal more damage in one hit and can penetrate through multiple targets. However, this comes at the major cost of requiring the cannon to cool down in between shots, which takes quite a long time since the stabilizer needs to expunge a larger amount of energy before the cannon is safe to use again.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.title=Impulse Cannon: Burst-fire Conversion
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.0=Since I have left the Impulse Cannon open for any further augmentation I may wish to add, I may as well spend some time creating one to change how the weapon fires. One way to go would be to fire a set amount of energy all at once, but I may also have some success in using a set amount of energy to fire multiple small beams.<BR>I'll need to create a set of lenses that modulate the impetus beam so that it is spaced out over set intervals of time, these lenses being placed in the focusing chamber where the beam travels through.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.1=The schematics for this augment, which I am calling the Burst-fire Conversion Kit, are now complete.<BR>The augment, when built and attached to the cannon in the usual manner of placing it in a crafting window with said cannon, changes the firing method so that it fires three beams in a short burst, which each do a fair bit more damage than the normal beam. This comes with the price of having a cooldown after each shot, which isn't too long but does leave me exposed for a second or two.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.title=Arcane Terraformer
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.0=For some time now, I have pondered the possibility of artificially manipulating the natural world around me in ways normally impossible. For instance, while it is possible for anyone with enough time, strength, and resourcefulness to manipulate the terrain around them to fit their needs, they cannot truly change the underlying biomes that the area exists within. I have desired to break this rule enforced upon the world by all of reality, but the magic I have had access to has not been enough to change this fact.<BR>At least, until now. My studies into the volatile and transmutative properties of impetus have now opened a door for me, one that leads to the possibility of true world-manipulating power. Even with this knowledge, changing the underlying biomes in the world will require a great deal of magical force and a certain level of ingenuity, given that I will need to permanently alter the aura around me to successfully terraform an area.<BR>To gain an insight into the momentous task ahead of me, I will need to open my mind to the wider world around me and see the many sights and sounds it offers. This means exploring and visiting a few different biomes in the world, to see how reality fundamentally operates in them and observe the subtle changes in this operation between biomes.
research.m_OCEAN.text=Visit a place where the land and sea meet
research.m_MOUNTAIN.text=Enter a location with peaks that touch the sky
research.m_DESERT.text=Find a sun-scorned place
research.m_FOREST.text=Explore a dense, leafy area
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.1=The true scale of the natural and supernatural world is still as unclear as ever, but despite that I have gained brief glimpses and flashes of understanding that have taught me how I can change it far more than I could before. In front of me I have a set of designs that detail a device that uses the combined power of the aura, the elements, and the Void to terraform the world around it, changing biomes precisely how I instruct it to. Appropriately, I have named this device the Arcane Terraformer.<BR>The Terraformer itself is all packed into a single contraption, but it requires a great deal of additional equipment and setup in order to function. I will cover the device in detail for my future reference; it is a very complex piece of arcane engineering, and it is far too easy for me to forget the specifics of its functionality.<BR>The first step to bending the world to my will is to configure the specific biome that the Arcane Terraformer will convert the area around it into. I have created a special Biome Focus to serve this purpose. To attune the focus to a biome, I simply need to visit the biome in question and use the Focus within it. This will store the intrinsic properties of the biome in the Focus, a sort of "fingerprint", which will later allow the Arcane Terraformer to perfectly replicate it. Sneaking while using the focus will clear its current biome, allowing it to be reused.<BR>I have already considered a potential dilemma I may face after terraforming: what if I want to restore the land to its original state? To save myself the headache of manually managing Biome Foci, I have found a way to allow the Terraformer to perfectly restore the original biome or biomes in its area of operation. I refer to this as the primeval state, as it is the way the land was originally formed. At least, original enough for my purposes. To create a primeval Biome Focus, I only need to place the Focus with a primordial pearl in a crafting grid. This does not consume any portion of the pearl, since the Focus only absorbs the pearl's ambient energy.<BR>The first step in actually using the Terraformer is to access its configuration panel by using the device after placing it in the world. At the centre of the panel is where I place the configured Biome Focus, which gets affixed to the top of the device. On the right are the area settings, which allow me to specify both the size and shape of the terraforming area. The left side will display the amount of essentia I need to fully terraform the entire selected area, assuming I have a Biome Focus inserted into the Terraformer.<BR>I then need to ensure that the Arcane Terraformer has access to sufficient amounts of three resources: vis, essentia, and impetus. Vis is simple enough, as the Terraformer will simply draw a small amount of Vis from the area it is placed in for each square metre of the world it converts. Impetus is slightly more complicated, as I must connect a charged impetus input into the central jewel at the bottom of the device.<BR>The last ingredient is essentia, and a lot of it. There are five types of essentia that the Arcane Terraformer could potentially need to terraform the area. These are Ignis, Aqua, Aer, Terra, and Permutatio. The first four are the primal elemental aspects, and these will be required if they are a part of the biome that is to be terraformed into. Fiery or hot biomes will need Ignis, damp biomes require aqua, and so on. Some biomes may not need a certain elemental aspect of essentia at all. However, every biome requires Permutatio in some capacity - this is what allows the Terraformer to actually exchange the biomes. The exact amount of essentia required increases with the amount of area that needs to be terraformed, which can be seen on the left side of the information panel as previously mentioned. This is probably one of the most essentia-hungry devices I have designed to date, since it requires so much to permanently change the physical world. If I plan on using this device frequently or over a large area, I should prepare plenty of essentia jars filled with the four elemental aspects and permutatio.<BR>With all of this setup done, I will be able to finally start the terraforming process by using a casting gauntlet on the Arcane Terraformer. If I need to cancel it for any reason, I can use a gauntlet on it a second time, although any terraforming that was already done will not revert.<BR>Despite the high resource cost the device needs to terraform an area, there is a major benefit I can gain from selecting certain biomes: I can increase the vis cap of the local aura. As part of the terraforming process, the Arcane Terraformer restabilizes the aura in any area it has terraformed. When transforming biomes with little vis to more magically attuned biomes, such as magical forests, the maximum vis that the area can hold will be dramatically increased. This can be especially helpful should my base of operations be located in an area with lower amounts of natural vis. However, the aura can also have its cap be lowered in this way, so I need to monitor the aura in areas I have terraformed, lest I unexpectedly run out of vis.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.title=Feeding Rifts
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.0=Flux rifts can grow to some fairly large sizes simply by absorbing flux from the local aura, but they can only do so to a certain limit. At some point, it grows large enough where it cannot absorb flux efficiently enough to grow any further. This can present a problem in that if I am draining a rift for one reason or another, I need to constantly monitor its size to ensure I do not drain it out of existence. Furthermore, I would rather not have to repeatedly pollute the aura in order to keep the rift at a decent size, as the flux can spread to other areas and generally cause a mess.<BR>There has to be a better way to grow my flux rifts. After some thinking, I believe there might be a solution to this problem. In my previous efforts around flux management, I managed to create the Flux Condenser, which draws flux from the aura and condenses it into Vitium essentia. I do not see a reason why I would not be able to do the opposite.<BR>It is already technically possible to do such a thing, in that I can simply place a jar of essentia and empty it into the aura as flux, but this is not what I need. Instead, I will need to transfer the flux carefully by focusing it all into a specific point, which in this case would be a flux rift. I will need to be careful with my experimentation here, as flux has a habit of being very insidious in how it pollutes an area. The last thing I need is an infestation of taint eating away at my base of operations...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.1=I can now breathe a sigh of relief, as I have managed to successfully avoid creating a major flux problem, at least with this particular batch of research. I'd rather not think about the problems I may have already caused. §oAhem.§r<BR>Regardless, I have managed to reengineer my design for the Flux Condenser into a device I am calling the Flux Inducer. While its name might suggest that it creates flux in the area around it, this is not quite the truth, as the whole point of making this device is to avoid doing that. Rather, when pointed at a flux rift, the Inducer will be able to feed flux directly into it, causing the rift to grow. Because this directly inserts flux into the rift, instead of relying on it to absorb flux on its own, rifts should be able to grow far larger than they would normally be able to. My calculations suggest that they can grow twice as large as before, so I should ensure there is enough space for these massive rifts to grow without breaking vital equipment.<BR>However, nothing in this world ever seems to come without a price, and as such the Flux Inducer has some caveats to its operation. First and foremost, it needs Vitium essentia in order to grow a rift. It can be fed into any side of the device except its front, via the usual piping mechanisms. It can require a lot of Vitium to grow the rift, and the amount required gradually increases as the rift's size increases, so a steady supply of Vitium is a must. The original Flux Condenser would probably pair very well with the Flux Inducer for this purpose.<BR>Secondly, I need to ensure the device is placed facing the rift, as the front of the device contains the rift feeding mechanism. I can place the device facing me by simply placing it as normal, but if I sneak while placing it the Flux Inducer will be facing away from me. I will also need to ensure that the Inducer is kept within about 12 metres of the rift, and the rift is placed in view of the Inducer. I will know when the device is in range when faint, flux-coloured particles are being pulled from the Flux Inducer by the rift. This does not actually consume any Vitium essentia, nor does it affect the state of the rift in any discernible way.<BR>Thirdly, an important point to mention is that feeding a rift in this way will cause it to grow unstable. This is probably a side effect of inserting the flux into the rift, rather than letting the rift absorb flux at its own pace. I may wish to use one of the methods of stabilizing rifts I have researched, keeping in mind any byproducts (like flux) they produce.<BR>Finally, I can deactivate the Flux Inducer with a redstone signal. If the front nozzle of the Inducer is a bright purple, then it is active.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.title=Impetus Generator
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.0=Mundane electrical energy is something I have already managed to generate through Thaumaturgic means, despite how the two disciplines tend to work against each other. But while the Vis Generator is quite effective, it is still limited in how much RF/FE it can output, due to the fact that the linking mechanism limits the conversion rate, and trying to go beyond this limit would most likely result in the magical and mundane energies making contact, creating all manner of havoc.<BR>However, I need not be limited by vis anymore, as my recent discovery of charged impetus provides me with an alternative method of generating kinetic energy which can then be used to power an electrical generator. From some cursory investigation, impetus interacts with mundane power differently than vis does. Its unpredictable and volatile nature ironically means that it isn't so strongly affected by it, as it can adapt itself to become resistant to mundane power's negative influence, so I should be able to use it to generate electricity faster than I can with vis.<BR>This new generator shouldn't be too hard to prototype since I already have the framework designed with the Vis Generator. If I swap out the appropriate vis and aura-related components with Void and impetus-centric ones, and modify the underlying linkages and energy containment systems to account for the more unpredictable forces of the Void, I should be able to feed these into the same axle and electrical generator that I used for the Vis Generator.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.1=After some further study of impetus power and reworking of the designs for the Vis Generator, I now have access to a new RF/FE generating device which uses the powers of the Void in its operation as opposed to the vis I have been using previously. It takes a few more advanced components to create and requires charged impetus in order to run, but it can generate electrical power at a far better rate than the Vis Generator.<BR>Once built, the Impetus Generator is used in a very similar way to the Vis Generator. Firstly, it must be directly attached to an appropriate redstone flux or forge energy using, transferring, or storing block. Secondly, a beam of charged impetus energy must be linked into it using the Impetus Resonator to do so. Then, once the Impetus Generator receives charged impetus power, it will generate 1500 RF/FE for a small amount of impetus, of which it can output 50 RF/FE per tick. The output speed, while still limited, is much better than the Vis Generator's, so if I have any magical devices that need mundane energy to run (or if I am dabbling in the use of mundane technology and feel like using more esoteric means of generating power) then this can act as an excellent source of it.<BR>As with most of my devices, the generator can be turned off with a redstone signal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.title=Rift Relocation
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.0=The fabric of reality does seem to be a very fickle thing, and one may find evidence for this in how flux rifts appear.<BR>When an area gains too much flux, a rift appears, this is well documented. However, where the rift appears is an inexact science. They generally appear on the surface, or at the highest point where there is solid ground. But even with that in mind, where they precisely appear is almost impossible to predict. I would rather not have to work around this behaviour, instead, I would prefer to have the option to move the rift to wherever I choose.<BR>Moving something that extends into higher dimensions will not be an easy feat to undertake, however. While I could hypothetically 'drag' the rift to a particular spot, I imagine this could have some particularly destructive effects on the fabric of reality, so I will have to be a little more creative in how I move them.<BR>Warded jars are specially designed to contain dangerous substances, primarily essentia. However, with some additional modifications I might be able to have them hold a small pocket of space within them, that space including a rift breaking through it. This would therefore prevent any negative effects that simply moving the rift around would have, since it would all be contained safely within the jar.<BR>While this is all good in theory, I still haven't found a way to actually do this, and I haven't thought of a way to get a rift into a jar in the first place. One might think this is a major setback and that it might as well be impossible, but as a Thaumaturge I do the impossible on a regular basis. Magic is a very powerful thing, after all.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.1=I have spent a great deal of effort further analysing the dimensional magic that flux rifts are a product of, and as a result of that effort I have now designed a method for moving them from one place to another. The process requires some very specialised equipment, which is unsurprising given what I am working with.<BR>There are a total of three things I will need to move a rift from one place to another: a special type of warded jar to contain the rift; a device that can pull the rift inside itself and place it within the jar; and a device that can take the rift out of the jar and project it back out into the world. I shall cover each one in turn.<BR>Firstly, the jar. I have designed this jar to be far sturdier than a normal jar, in order to contain a volatile rift and the space in which it inhabits. To that end, it contains additional protective glyphs, an additional warding sigil and a set of sturdy magically resistant metal braces, all to prevent the rift from breaking loose. It cannot be used to store essentia anymore, but this hardly matters since it wouldn't have any particular benefit for that purpose over an ordinary warded jar.<BR>Secondly, the device that places the rift into a jar, which I am calling the Metaspatial Accumulator. It is a complex device able to carefully manipulate space in dimensions beyond the ordinary three, so it would be wise to make sure that I do not lose it once I have it. To use it, I only need to place it beneath a flux rift (making sure that the rift does not destroy it in the process), place a reinforced jar directly below the device (if I can see the device connected to the jar then I have set it up correctly), and then to actually store the rift in the jar I use the Accumulator with a caster's gauntlet.<BR>This jarring process can take some time depending on how big the rift is, and as it is being jarred the rift will lose stability, but if the process is successful then the rift will vanish and be placed within the jar. It would be wise to stand back when the rift vanishes though, as when a rift closes or collapses it creates a sudden shift in reality that is quite unpleasant to the psyche of nearby people who experience it (and I'd rather not think too hard about the damage already done to my mind).<BR>However, the jarring process can fail in a few different ways. Firstly, if the rift is so unstable that it tries to collapse, then the rift will 'snap back' to its original size and become extremely unstable, stopping the Accumulator in the process. It will fail in a similar way if I deliberately try to collapse the rift with a causality collapser. In some cases, instead of "snapping back" to its full size, it will instead release a large amount of flux. This seems to occur when the rift would disappear in a manner other than collapsing, such as when a taint seed is produced. The Metaspatial Accumulator will also fail if it or the Reinforced jar is broken. I should also note that if there is still a lot of flux in the area when the rift is successfully jarred, then another rift may appear immediately afterwards, so I should be prepared for that.<BR>Thirdly, getting the rift out of the jar. To do that, I will need a third device I have named the Metaspatial Extruder. The unjarring process is very similar to the jarring one, so I must first place the Extruder down, and place a jarred rift directly underneath it. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can see an estimation of where the rift will be placed above the device. To begin, I simply need to use a caster's gauntlet on the device. The rift will then gradually begin to appear above the device, and if the process is successful then the rift will fully form, emptying the connected jar. If the Extruder tries to place the rift close to a rift that is already present, then the device will not start the process as a safety measure, as that could get very dangerous. If the process is interrupted by the rift collapsing or the device/jar being broken, then the rift will dissipate entirely, leaving nothing more than a large cloud of flux behind, which might form a new rift in the process.<BR>There are risks involved with all of this, there is no doubt, but I cannot turn back now, and if the worst that can happen with either machine is that another flux rift is created, then so be it. After all, I can just use that flux rift instead.<BR>Finally, of note is that I can keep rifts inside reinforced jars indefinitely, so they can work well for decorative purposes, since they are safe if not disturbed. The rift will break free chaotically if the jar is destroyed in something like lava or fire however, which will create a lot of flux, cause the rift to become very unstable while also destroying the jar completely, so if I want to get the rift out then using the Metaspatial Extruder is the better thing to do. I am unsure what will happen if I try to destroy a jarred rift in a more unique way, such as with purely technological systems designed to store and catalogue items, so I should be prepared for the worst if I decide to study disciplines outside of Thaumaturgy and use them to destroy a jarred rift.<BR>Interestingly, a jarred rift can even be used as a means of item destruction in itself. If a device such as a hopper or golem is used to place items in it, then those items will be completely destroyed. The rift will become a little unstable as it does so, but since it is contained it will regain its stability soon after. This does leave me with a dark thought, however: what if I were to jar two rifts, and then try and destroy one jarred rift by placing it in the other, or if I were to throw one jarred rift into a rift present in the world? If I am not fully prepared to find out the answer to this conundrum, then playing it safe may be for the best...

thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.title=Advanced Stabilization Methods
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.0=Dangerous magic is often naturally unstable, as chaotic magical energies are created that need to be released in one form or another, this form generally being very unpleasant for any Thaumaturge who happens to be nearby. Thus, on behalf of all Thaumaturges, I have decided to find a better way to deal with unstable magic, in this case unstable magic made by flux rifts.<BR>I have already designed a device that can stabilize flux rifts, the stabilizer, but as it was originally designed to stabilize arcane infusions it is not very effective at dealing with the more distributed form of instability that a rift creates. It works very slowly if I am only using a few, I cannot turn it off when I need to, and it creates a lot of flux that can actually make a flux rift grow even worse. It is a little bit like using a bucket of lava to put out a house fire: yes, the lava may smother some of the flames, but the lava itself is creating even more fire which spreads everywhere, and suddenly I am left without a house, the house being analogous for a stable aura I suppose.<BR>Regardless, I know I can do better than this. The Stabilizer's ability to stabilize flux rifts is only a side effect created by how it works, so if I instead try to create a stabilizing device designed to work on flux rifts specifically, then I should be much more successful than before.<BR>Previously, I used a limited amount of mundane technology in the form of a redstone block to stabilize infusions, so I am now wondering if I can use mundane technology in a slightly more advanced fashion to get a better result. I have already managed to generate mundane electrical power in the form of RF/FE with the vis generator, so perhaps I should try to study ordinary electricity a little further? Simply bombarding a flux rift with electricity won't work, however, so I'll need to be intelligent with how I apply it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.1=Mundane technology has once again provided me with the answer to my stability problems. Previously I had trouble properly understanding the links between electrical power and magical power, but after some careful study I now understand a little better how the two may interact with one another. Generally this means rather poorly, but if I am careful I should be able to use one to neutralise or otherwise restrict the other. In this case, I can use electricity in the form of redstone flux or forge energy to quell unstable rift energies.<BR>To facilitate this interaction, I have taken my design for the infusion stabilizer and heavily reworked it, so much so that my new design only vaguely resembles the old one. I am calling this new design the Stability Field Generator. It uses a few different magical and technological principles in order to operate. By taking RF or FE, sending it through some additional redstone circuits and stabilizing runes and then discharging it through an amber tip, it fires a beam which creates a containment field of sorts. The amber is a key component here; by applying sympathetic magic, I can use it to 'trap' a flux rift in a field of stabilizing energy, which will cause it to rapidly regain stability without the flux problem that a normal stabilizer creates.<BR>To use the device, I first need to point it so that its tip faces a flux rift. Then, I need to feed in mundane RF/FE into any side of the device except its front, since the front is where the field is emitted from. I may want to use vis generators for this, as they are very compact and can feed their power directly into a port on the Stability Field Generator. Once it receives power, the front of the device will open, and it will fire the stability field directly at the rift. It uses 100 RF/FE every second while active, which is not exactly cheap, but I have built the device so that it can be turned off by applying a redstone signal to it. The more Stability Field Generators I use on a rift, the faster it will regain stability.<BR>One major drawback that the device has is that when it is left on for extended periods of time, the stabilizing field will gradually begin to lose effectiveness as the internal mechanics begin to overheat. However, if the device is turned off, it will cool down over a period of time and eventually fully recover. I can tell how overheated a Stability Field Generator is based on two visual cues. The first is the transparency of the beam it produces, with a less opaque beam being less efficient. The other sign is the presence of electricity discharging across it, visible as red electrical arcs on and around the device. Given that it will consume the same amount of energy but mitigate much less instability while overheated, it would be wise to make sure that I turn off any Stability Field Generators when I do not need them. Hypothetically speaking, it should be reasonable for me to automate such a process.<BR>While I can readily use my Thaumaturgy-specific means of generating electricity for the device to use, it will accept power from anywhere else as long as that power is in the form of RF or FE. Thus, if I have access to more advanced technological systems that can generate that form of electricity, or even alternate magical disciplines that interact with mundane energy, then I can use any power generators provided by them in order to power the stability field.<BR>I should note that since this device is designed to work on the more distributed form of instability that a flux rift creates, it will not be able to stabilize infusions. A pity, but it would be difficult to redesign the device a second time to work like that, and I already have the infusion stabilizer for that purpose anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.title=Monitoring Dimensional Effects
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.0=While I can learn a fair amount about a flux rift just by simple observation, I can only understand so much with the naked eye alone. I need a better way to study them, which I believe will require a new, specialized device.<BR>Previously I have created the Thaumic Dioptra, which uses a Thaumometer to analyse the aura in a wide radius before displaying the strengths of vis and flux as a heightmap. I believe I can rework this design, but instead make the Thaumometer at its core receptive to the energies produced by flux rifts. I could use the readings created by this device for a few different purposes, so I am sure the final product will be well worth the research.<BR>I simply must try to learn more about extra-dimensional phenomenon. Despite the risks involved, it is all so very fascinating...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.1=Interesting... so very interesting... this has all been something of a learning exercise, and I now know quite a bit more about flux rifts than I did before. This knowledge will be absolutely invaluable for my future studies into dimensional magic, in fact these studies have already borne fruit in a new device I have designed, which I am calling the Extradimensional Monitor.<BR>The device contains a heavily modified Thaumometer at its core, with specially selected runes designed to make it sensitive to the energies produced by phenomena that breach into higher dimensional space. There are quite a few things that create these energies, however, so I have made sure that it only responds to the particular signature that a flux rift creates, otherwise things like Nether or End portals could interfere with the device and produce false readings.<BR>Once placed down, the Monitor scans the local area and once it picks up something it recognises, it will begin collecting data about it, projecting that data on the display above. In the case of flux rifts, the device will display a hologram of the rift it is monitoring. It has a fairly large radius in which it can pick up rifts, but I should note that if a monitor is placed down and the rift changes size, this may cause the rift to go outside the range of the monitor and therefore it will lose track of it, so if I am monitoring a rift that changes size frequently then I should try to keep the monitor fairly close by.<BR>The device has two modes that I can switch between by right-clicking the device, these modes being for size and stability. Size mode analyses how large a flux rift is. The grid below has a pair of markers that show how tall a two block stack is in comparison to the size of the flux rift, so I can use that to tell roughly how big the rift is compared to myself. Stability mode is designed to monitor the rift's stability, unsurprisingly. The view is pulled in closer to a cross-section of the rift hologram, and from there I can observe how much the rift is shaking to better see how unstable it is. As I have noted before, a perfectly stable rift will be perfectly still, and a very unstable one will thrash about violently.<BR>Another feature the device has, one that may prove to be particularly useful, is its ability to create a redstone signal. By connecting a redstone comparator to the side of the monitor, the comparator will output a redstone signal that correlates to the current size or stability of the rift it is analysing, depending on what mode the monitor is set to. For instance, if the monitor is set to size mode, then the comparator signal will become stronger the larger the rift is, and if it is set to stability mode, the comparator signal will get stronger the more stable the rift is. I can see potential future use in automatic rift management systems with this feature, like ensuring that a void siphon draining the rift is turned off if the rift gets too small or unstable.<BR>As the dimensional fractures I have discovered are a naturally appearing variant of flux rifts that create a bridge across dimensions, the Extradimensional Monitor can very easily be tuned to analyse them. As with flux rifts, the device has two modes for fracture reading.<BR>Mode one reads the fracture and shows some details about where it leads to. A 7 by 7 grid is displayed beneath the fracture, with this showing the ambient colours of the biome that it leads to. The potential grass colour of the biome is displayed in the 3x3 centre of the grid, the potential foliage colour is displayed in the hollow 5x5 grid around that, and the water colour is displayed in the hollow 7x7 grid around that. This is somewhat limited, but I can gain some insight about the destination, with greener colours of grass and foliage leading to more lush areas, yellower colours of grass leading to arid areas like deserts, darker coloured water likely leading to swamp-like areas, so on and so forth. Different dimensions are also indicated this way, so to better differentiate them from biomes in the Overworld.<BR>Mode two pulls the view in closer to the fracture, but unlike with rifts it does not monitor stability, since fractures do not get unstable. Instead, it just provides a closer look, which I can use to see if the fracture is open or closed.<BR>I am learning so much about dimensional tears as of late, and I can sense such potential lurking here. For now, I can only imagine what I might be able to create with all of this knowledge in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primordial_wisp.title=Primordial Wisp
thaumicaugmentation.research.primordial_wisp.0=Whatever I was expecting to be created as the result of a flux rift being destroyed by another flux rift, I cannot say that it was this. Apparently the combination of two chaotic tears in reality creates life, or at least something resembling it, and this life does not seem to appreciate my part in its creation.<BR>I have seen wisps before, but none as powerful as this one. Unlike the single dimensional core that a normal wisp has, this one seems to be made up of multiple dimensional singularities closely orbiting one another, with each one being attuned to a different primal energy. It attacks like a normal wisp, but unlike a normal wisp it is always hostile to me, and it can take far more damage before eventually being destroyed too.<BR>It also seems to react to its surroundings, drawing energy from both the aura and the matter around it. This leads me to believe that its abilities may be slightly different, depending on what materials it has available to it.<BR>Despite how unexpected and how dangerous this discovery is, it may still be of use to me. If I am prepared then I should try and kill this powerful wisp, as I believe the fading dimensional energies may congeal into something far more valuable than the simple vis crystal that an ordinary wisp creates.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.title=Gauntlet Vis Storage
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.0=I have made great strides in the efficacy of my casting, allowing me access to more powerful, rapid, or efficient spellcasting. Even with all of these improvements, however, there is still one major issue with relying on foci: in the absence of a suitably strong Aura, I am left being unable to use any of my focus effects, no matter how much gauntlet augmentation I have done.<BR>That being said, repurposing my older creations has been the solution to many thaumaturgical problems, and I believe this is no exception. Vis Batteries do almost exactly what I need; they absorb Vis when it is plentiful, and release it if the Aura is depleted. The only challenge will be somehow limiting the Vis Batteries to only potentially release vis when casting, but I have always found ways around these dilemmas in the past, and do not intend to let this break that trend.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.1=Although it does not feel like it, I have made another great stride in my studies of Auromancy. My invention of portable Vis Batteries in augment form has eliminated one of its major weaknesses.<BR>The Vis Battery augment works similarly to a normal Vis Battery. It can only charge itself with Vis by direct exposure to the Aura, not through any other method. It will also only take in Vis when the Aura is at least 90% saturated with vis. Unlike Vis Batteries, the augment will not automatically discharge when in a weak Aura. Instead, it will discharge Vis if the focus I am attempting to cast requires more Vis than is available in the Aura. This means I cannot use it as a true portable Vis battery, as I cannot arbitrarily decide to release the stored Vis into the Aura, but this was never the goal to begin with.<BR>While I have successfully linked four Vis Batteries in series in the final augment, the total vis capacity is still somewhat low. I may want to combine this augment with others that reduce the total casting cost if I frequently find myself drawing from the very limited pool of stored vis.

thaumicaugmentation.research.item_grate.title=Item Grate
thaumicaugmentation.research.item_grate.0=When it comes to automation and item management, certain situations require very particular tools or devices. Dealing with items in the world is generally a simple matter, but in some cases I may wish to let items pass through into an area whilst I or anything else cannot.<BR>While I could resort to a Thaumaturgical solution, I do not believe a problem as mundane as this warrants it. A combination of a trapdoor with an iron grate will work just as well, creating a simple yet effective Item Grate.<BR>The Item Grate can be opened and closed, either by hand or via a redstone signal (any signal closes, no signal opens). If closed, nothing can pass through it. If open, items dropped in the world can pass through it while anything else, including living creatures, cannot.<BR>Finally, it works well with item transport devices such as hoppers, allowing them to drop items directly through the Grate, but only as long as it is open.
thaumicaugmentation.research.item_grate.1=§lStore Seal§r<DIV>The store seal should work particularly well with the Grate. If placed on top of the Grate, the seal will instruct capable golems to drop items directly through it, while golems themselves cannot pass through. However, golems will only drop items through the Grate if it is open, otherwise they will ignore the Grate entirely.
thaumicaugmentation.research.item_grate.2=§lArcane Levitators§r<DIV>Arcane Levitators should pair nicely with the Item Grate. The Levitator's beam passes seamlessly through an open Grate, allowing levitated items through it while blocking anything else. Furthermore, a closed Grate will prevent the Levitator from lifting anything on the other side of the grate.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumium_robes.title=Robes of the Adept
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumium_robes.0=I have had access to robes made of enchanted fabric for a while now, but in hindsight they seem somewhat… §olacking.§r They offer me little to no protection against the creatures that inhabit this world. I cannot let the risk of danger stop my research, but at the same time it would be foolish of me to not be prepared to defend myself. Thankfully, I believe I may be able to enhance my original robes with my recently invented thaumium.<BR>Thaumium's unique magical conductivity may very well prove beneficial to spell-casting, augmenting the already magically attuned enchanted fabric very effectively. Furthermore, addition of the metal should also provide more protection from attacks, perhaps even from non-physical ones.<BR>I'll need to plan an appropriate set of infusion recipes to create these new robes, so while I am working on them I may as well improve the robes' visual design too. After all, any Thaumaturge worth their salt should aim to strike a good balance between functionality, efficiency and style.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumium_robes.1=Thaumium has proven itself to be an excellent metal to work with, meshing well with enchanted fabric. I now have a set of infusion recipes for the Robes of the Adept, including a hood with built-in Goggles of Revealing, a chest-piece and a pair of leggings. I have left out the boots as I feel I may be able to enhance them in a very different way, to allow them to do more than just protect me.<BR>Regardless, these new robes offer far better protection than before, with the additional thaumium plates being able to absorb both physical and magical attacks. Furthermore, the robes also have an improved vis discount on them, allowing me to cast spells and craft magical items just a little more efficiently. They also accept enchantments very well, again due to the thaumium used to make them.<BR>Additionally, I have improved the robes' visual design and I can even recolour them if I so wish. To do this, I simply have to craft the robes with dye(s) in a crafting window, and to wash the dye out I just have to use the robes on a filled, mundane cauldron.<BR>Finally, if I do not want my face to be shrouded in darkness inside the hood, I can place the hood in a crafting grid to move some fabric and allow light in. I can then change the hood back to its original form in the same way.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumium_robes.2=While I have created faceplates for the Thaumium Fortress Armor, it would be a shame to not adapt them to be usable for the Robes of the Adept as well. All of them maintain their special properties when used with these robes, and are still applied via a standard arcane infusion. The integrated Goggles of Revealing are kept when adding a faceplate to the hood.

thaumicaugmentation.research.glass_tube.title=Glass Essentia Tube
thaumicaugmentation.research.glass_tube.0=Essentia piping systems are a major step forward in thaumaturgic alchemy, but this comes at the price of additional complexity. Managing tube systems can easily become confusing, especially since I cannot easily tell at a glance where and when essentia is flowing, what with all tube types being fully opaque.<BR>This was not done by choice, as previously I was not able to find a way to make a pipe primarily made of glass survive the constant barrage of magical essence. However, I may be able to revisit my previous studies and find a way to make glass resistant to even the most volatile of essentia. Perhaps I should look into warded jars as a starting point.
thaumicaugmentation.research.glass_tube.1=After some further investigation into essentia and piping systems that use it, I was able to rework my designs for ordinary essentia tubes into a new one. With some additional warding magic to seal any remaining gaps, I now have plans ready for a special type of essentia tube that is fully see-through but resistant to essentia leaking or melting through it.<BR>Glass Essentia Tubes work in exactly the same way as ordinary essentia tubes, but their transparent nature means I can see what essentia is flowing through them without needing to use an essentia resonator. This may be useful if I am struggling to understand what my piping systems are doing.<BR>I was not able to make glass versions of my more complex tube types, however. The various mechanisms, valves and such used in them need to be contained by more sturdy metal. However, all of my other tube types do still connect to glass tubes, and as before I can connect and disconnect glass tube segments using my caster's gauntlet.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_infusion.title=Further Infusion Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_infusion.0=Arcane Infusion has opened up so many possibilities for what I can create. I shall have to see what may be possible with this more advanced crafting method.<BR>However, designing an Infusion Altar can be difficult, so as additional guidance I have marked blocks that help to stabilize infusion altars. When viewing a block's tooltip, if it also reads §5Infusion Stabilizer§r then that block will work as such when placed around the altar in symmetrical patterns, as long as it is not used in too great a number.

thaumicaugmentation.research.celestial_observer.title=Celestial Observer
thaumicaugmentation.research.celestial_observer.0=While I have already found that the phases of the moon affect the aura, I am still unsure of the specifics of this connection. Furthermore, my new technique of scanning celestial features can be a tedious task to do every day and night, one that is far, §ofar§r too easy for me to forget to do. This can leave me in a position where I require particular celestial notes to continue with my theorycrafting but I have no way of getting them for some time. When I find myself in frustrating positions such as these, it can help to look at it from a wider perspective, and from there try to find potential solutions in even the most unusual of places.<BR>In regards to the heavens, there are references in pages of the thaumonomicon to a particular type of magic that channels power held by distant star constellations; a type of practical astrology if you will. It has links to thaumaturgy, and I suspect that ancient thaumaturges may have invented or discovered the practice. Whether or not this kind of magic is possible for me is irrelevant, what is relevant is that I could apply such astral studies back onto thaumaturgy.<BR>Some of these records detail magnifying devices used to study distant stars, including free-standing telescopes. If I were to take this idea but use it with thaumic scanning techniques I may be able to get a more detailed look at what the celestial bodies are doing to the aura. Furthermore, if I were to use some simple golemancy I might be able to allow the device to automatically take notes of the skies above, saving me a great deal of time and effort from doing it myself. This would be tremendously helpful, and by designing it I may be able to learn a little more about the aura and its connection to the wider universe.
thaumicaugmentation.research.celestial_observer.1=Ah, now this should help me greatly in my celestial studies. I have prepared plans for what I am calling the Celestial Observer, which is designed as a telescope with a variety of thaumaturgic capabilities. It contains focusing lenses that allow it to view distant celestial features with a clarity unavailable to me previously, and thanks to an attached thaumometer it can perform automated scans and subsequent note-taking of these features without the need for ink. It is also capable of observing the effects of these celestial bodies on the local aura.<BR>Once I have built it, I simply need to place it down in an area with a clear, open view of the sky (opaque blocks placed above it will prevent it from working). I can access its menu by using it, which contains the main viewing lens, toggle buttons for celestial features, a slot to hold paper to use for note-taking and a fairly large inventory to hold completed celestial notes. The toggle buttons control what the device will scan, so if, say, I wish to stop sun scans then I simply turn the corresponding option off. The viewport will show what the Observer is viewing at the time, such as the sun or moon, or even anything placed in front of it. To the side it will also show measurements detailing how the currently present celestial body is affecting the aura.<BR>After some cursory examination of the data collected by the Celestial Observer, I now have a deeper knowledge of how the celestial bodies affect the aura. While the sun and stars appear to have little to no influence on the aura, the moon seems to be connected to small but noticeable changes in it. Like the tides of an ocean, the capacity of the aura seems to oscillate between a high and low point. Strong moon phases (such as a full moon) tend to boost the amount of vis the aura can contain and can also help to regenerate vis more quickly, while weak moon phases (such as a new moon) lack this effect. While flux can build in a depleted or oversaturated aura during any phase of the moon, the aura does seem to be slightly more resistant to this effect during strong moon phases, with less flux being produced. While it is helpful to clarify these observations in writing, I am still unsure as to the precise mechanics behind this behaviour, or even if the moon is truly the cause of these changes in the aura or just another indicator. The moon is a mysterious entity and it does have connections to other magical phenomena, so I can only imagine what metaphysical influences are at play here.<BR>While the Observer can hold 64 sheets of paper and a rather large amount of completed scans, it is also able to automatically pick up additional paper stored in any container placed below it and can output completed scans into containers placed horizontally next to it. This allows for easy automation, alleviating any problems I may have had with forgetting to perform regular celestial scans.<BR>Finally, the device will not work in poor weather conditions. It will not be able to perform scans, and because it will not be able to see any celestial features I will not be able to see how they are affecting the aura. It is also unlikely to work in dimensions outside of the Overworld, obviously with subterranean ones like the Nether but also in open-air dimensions with more unique skies. It may work in special dimensions that have a clear view of the sun and moon, or perhaps a sun and moon of some kind, but I shouldn't get my hopes up as the wider multiverse can be a strange, strange place indeed.
